Towards the end of last year, my business partner (Rich) was eager to get hold of the new MacBook Pro (with 15&#8243; Retina display) &#8211; obviously with the cost of the MacBook being considerably higher than an average PC-laptop counterpart &#8211; Rich felt it was unfair for him to get one. However since I&#8217;d never owned a Mac before &#8211; and heard how developers absolutely \*love\* using them, I thought it would be good for me to get one too. Rich was delighted!

On a side-note, another reason for wanting a MacBook was to play with Mono/.NET &#8211; it would be an attempt to shift my mindset on being more cross-platform focused.  This hasn&#8217;t happened yet &#8211; and highly doubt it will now &#8211; but more on that later.

When the MacBook arrived it was like Christmas day, unwrapping a thing of beauty.  The build of the machine is truly excellent, the hardware is fantastic and OS X looks amazing, (obviously &#8211; it&#8217;s the Retina display!)

Playing around with OS X was fine, it&#8217;s a nice operating-system, but I wasn&#8217;t overly excited about it &#8211; I put that down to not knowing what to do with it, (e.g. a project to work on), rather than the OS itself.  So given than I&#8217;m a .NET developer &#8211; the next thing I want is to install Windows.  For this I used Parallels Desktop 8 to run an instance of Windows 8 (from our MSDN subscription). Once I got Visual Studio 2012 set-up and a test Umbraco install up and running, I was ready to work.

After a few days of Umbraco/.NET development inside the VM, I realised that I never used OS X &#8211; again maybe this was because I didn&#8217;t know how to \*use\* it, or that I&#8217;m so focused on development that I only use the tools I need to get my job done?  Wanting to give OS X some justice, I installed Chrome and Skype, and tried using them by switching between them and VM &#8211; this turned out to be a horrible experience for me; I kept losing a mental focus.

Next up it was time to try Boot Camp.  At the time (January/February 2013), Boot Camp 4 didn&#8217;t officially support Windows 8, but having read several blog posts saying that it would work, I gave it a try.  The install was successful, but I kept hitting various issues &#8211; the screen resolution was ridiculously high (as you&#8217;d expect from a Retina display); the thunderbolt ethernet adapter is flakey.  Once Boot Camp 5 was released the various quirks got much better, (although the ethernet adapter still isn&#8217;t great).

I was much happier using Windows 8 via Boot Camp than as a VM &#8211; sure maybe I&#8217;d sacrificed my option for being &#8220;cross-platform&#8221;, but I felt that the machine (and/or I) was performing faster.

Was it **perfect developer bliss**? Sorry, afraid not (for me).

When I&#8217;m working at my office, I have the MacBook hooked up to dual-monitors and external keyboard and mouse. I&#8217;ve been using Microsoft&#8217;s Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 7000 for the past few years &#8211; as boring and corporate as it appears, it is an excellent keyboard &#8211; of course, I prefer using that.

In terms of mobility, the MacBook is awesome &#8211; it is very light, the battery is incredible, boots fast (from hibernate) &#8211; it ticked all the right boxes.  However, after months of use, the keyboard layout isn&#8217;t for me.  To be specific, the position of the &#8220;Fn&#8221; and &#8220;Ctrl&#8221; keys don&#8217;t feel right.  As a developer, my left hand&#8217;s little finger generally hovers over the bottom-left key &#8211; which is usually the &#8220;Ctrl&#8221; key &#8211; but not on the MacBook; it&#8217;s the &#8220;Fn&#8221; key!

At first I thought I&#8217;d get used to it&#8230; &#8220;just shift your finger over&#8221;, &#8220;Surely it can&#8217;t be that hard to adapt?&#8221; &#8211; well after several months of trying to adapt, I&#8217;m still hitting the &#8220;Fn&#8221; key to do most keyboard shortcuts &#8211; breaking my flow &#8211; &#8220;Huh?! Why didn&#8217;t it copy/paste?!!&#8221; I&#8217;ve started to call it the &#8220;F\***\*n\*&#8221; key!

Now that I&#8217;ve started to rant, I also dislike the &#8220;magic&#8221; touch-pad. When you press down on it (e.g. do a click), the sound is too loud/hard; especially when compared to the softer sound of pressing the keyboard! Becomes quite annoying when you&#8217;re working on train journey or sitting in a quiet office &#8230; \*click-click-click-click\*

It&#8217;s not all negative, the MacBook still is an excellent machine; I can see why people love using them so much. Alas it turns out that it&#8217;s not for me. During this year I&#8217;ve come to realise that I&#8217;m not as adaptable as I thought; old habits really do die hard; (but you know what, I&#8217;m okay with that).

Over the next month I&#8217;ll be looking for a new laptop &#8211; most likely a Dell Latitude or Lenovo &#8211; something with a boring corporate feel to it &#8211; of course it will have the best processor I can afford and 16GB+ RAM &#8230; oh and it will have the &#8220;Ctrl&#8221; key back in it&#8217;s rightful place.

I&#8217;ve just installed [Operator](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/4106) &#8211; a Firefox extension that highlights microformatted data on web pages.

So far I haven&#8217;t noticed any performance issues, and it&#8217;s been playing nicely with all my other Firefox extensions.

As a web developer, Operator makes me want to add more semantic mark-up to my websites, (which I already try to do). This extension will make it easier for testing purposes.

I decided to [read more about the extension on the developer&#8217;s blog](http://www.kaply.com/weblog/operator/) &#8211; to which I was pleasantly surprised to find that it uses my [Category Cloud widget](http://leekelleher.com/wordpress/plugins/category-cloud-widget/) (plug-in for WordPress). Along with a kudos-link back to my personal website. ([Thanks Mike!](http://www.kaply.com/)) :-D

A while ago I was curious to how many people were using my Category Cloud widget plug-in, so I added an opt-out &#8220;powered by&#8221; link. This way I could check my referrals or Google results count for [&#8220;Powered by Category Cloud&#8221;](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22--+Powered+by+Category+Cloud%22).

I&#8217;ve been amazed by the outcome of this. I honestly thought that everyone would opt-out of the link, yet they didn&#8217;t! So now my PageRank has increased; I&#8217;m in the [Technorati Top 10K](http://technorati.com/blogs/leekelleher.com?reactions) (which I definitely don&#8217;t deserve!); and I get a steady flow of traffic (low, but consistent).

I&#8217;ve tried to support the Category Cloud widget as best I can&#8230; so maybe it&#8217;s good karma?

I feel like I&#8217;ve been living under a rock for the last couple of months.  I&#8217;ve only just heard about [Mozilla&#8217;s Prism](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Prism) &#8211; and it&#8217;s already changing the way I use web-apps.

Prism, (previously called WebRunner), is essentially a Site Specific Browser (SSB) &#8211; meaning that it&#8217;s a desktop application designed to host a single web-application.  This is good for many reasons, foremost it causes less distractions.

So far, I have prisms set-up for most of the Google apps that I regularly use: Google Mail, Google Calendar and Google Reader.   Now each of these web-applications are not open as separate tabs in my Firefox, but as individual desktop applications.  (Now I don&#8217;t have to worry about finding my Gmail tab in Firefox, nor about browser-crashes.)

It reminds of Microsoft attempted to do with [HTA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_Application) &#8211; but it seemed more difficult to interface them with external web-applications.

You can read more about Mozilla Prism on their Lab&#8217;s blog. [<http://labs.mozilla.com/2007/10/prism/>]

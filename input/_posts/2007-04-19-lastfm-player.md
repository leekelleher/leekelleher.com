I was generally using my [last.fm account](http://www.last.fm/user/vertino/) to keep stats of the songs/artists that I listen to&#8230; I had no interest in the [Last.fm player](http://www.last.fm/tools/downloads/) software, as I use iTunes. Today I thought I&#8217;d give the [Personal radio](http://www.last.fm/listen/user/vertino/personal) feature a go&#8230; I&#8217;ve become addicted, especially with the **Discovery Mode** enabled!

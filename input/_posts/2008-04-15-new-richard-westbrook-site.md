[Bodenko](http://bodenko.com/) and [Crush Design](http://www.crushdesign.co.uk/) have just launch the new website for, Porsche Supercup champion, [Richard Westbrook](http://www.richardwestbrook.co.uk/).

We built the site with [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) (2.5) to take advantage of it&#8217;s blogging framework and also to be totally buzzword-compliant!<!--more-->

It&#8217;s not often that we get to mention the sites that we&#8217;ve built &#8211; usually due to the non-disclosure when doing [B2B](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B2B) projects.

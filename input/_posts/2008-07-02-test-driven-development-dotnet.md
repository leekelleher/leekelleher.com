Has anyone got any pointers on how I should start doing test-driven development in .NET?

It&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been meaning to look into for years now.  I&#8217;ve got all the usual Visual Studio add-ons installed&#8230; NUnit, TestDriven.NET, etc.  But no idea how to use them!

Usually I learn this stuff on the job, yet from most other developers I speak to &#8211; it&#8217;s all guess-work!

Any advice is much appreciated!

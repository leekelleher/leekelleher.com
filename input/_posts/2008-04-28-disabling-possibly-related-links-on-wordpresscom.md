When WordPress.com introduced [Snap Preview](http://wordpress.com/blog/2006/12/29/snap-to-it/) on our blogs (or is that their blogs?) at the end of 2006, I wasn&#8217;t impressed &#8211; it felt intrusive &#8211; like a JavaScript pop-up for Web 2.0! (Just given a different name). So I disabled it straight-away.

A few days ago, the WP.com team introduced a new feature &#8220;[Possibly Related Posts](http://wordpress.com/blog/2008/04/25/possibly-an-announcement/)&#8220;. At first I thought this was a great idea for finding similar content &#8211; but then I realised that it could become a mechanism for sploggers to inject links on your blog. (Obviously this feature is restricted to WP.com blogs only &#8211; which itself raises a few questions).

The other week I had a bit of a rant about how [Skype sneakily installed a Firefox Extension](http://blog.leekelleher.com/2008/04/14/sneaky-skype-installing-firefox-extension/) and that they should have provided an opt-in. [There](http://internetducttape.com/2008/04/27/fixing-the-wordpresscom-possibly-related-feature/) [has been a](http://larvatusprodeo.net/2008/04/28/wordpresscom-enables-another-new-feature-to-far-from-universal-acclaim/) [similar](http://amnesiablog.wordpress.com/2008/04/28/how-to-turn-off-wordpress-related-links/) [backlash](http://danamckay.wordpress.com/2008/04/28/add-the-features-your-users-want-not-the-features-you-want-them-to-have/) [about this](http://shewhostumbles.wordpress.com/2008/04/26/warning-the-new-wordpress-feature-is-utter-trollbait/) [new](http://saltedlithium.wordpress.com/2008/04/28/possibly-related-posts/) [WP.com](http://williamtildesley.wordpress.com/2008/04/28/how-dare-wordpress/) [feature](http://akhomeschoolfun.wordpress.com/2008/04/27/possibly-related-posts/)!

The blogosphere&#8217;s very own [Saraswathi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saraswati), the wise Lorelle has [wrote about her feelings on the matter and how to disable this new feature](http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2008/04/26/alert-possibly-related-posts-feature-on-wordpresscom-blogs/).

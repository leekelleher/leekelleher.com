After reading Dave&#8217;s post about [Twitter being the new Facebook](http://www.webdeveloper2.com/blog/2008/05/twitter-is-new-facebook.html) yesterday, I decided to give [Digsby](http://www.digsby.com/) a go. (I&#8217;d heard of it previously, but I was semi-scared off by all the twittermania &#8211; it&#8217;s a bit like marmite).

Since I was only following a few tweeters there wasn&#8217;t of a flow &#8211; so I added a couple more higher profile tweeters, like [Jeff Atwood&#8217;s Coding Horror](http://twitter.com/codinghorror/).

This morning Jeff tweeted:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="500">
  <p>
    I hate <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/region?src=hash">#region</a> so much. DIE <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/REGION?src=hash">#REGION</a> DIE!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &mdash; Jeff Atwood (@codinghorror) <a href="https://twitter.com/codinghorror/status/811735028">May 15, 2008</a>
  </p>
</blockquote>



I quite like [#region](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9a1ybwek(VS.71).aspx) in VS.NET, (it makes my code look/feel tidy). I was curious to why Jeff had a problem with it, so I tempted to reply to his tweet. But I stopped &#8211; thinking it was a bit of a fan-boy thing to do. Also I&#8217;m sure someone else would have asked the same question&#8230; which got me thinking how do you follow a conversation on Twitter?

I came across [Summize](http://summize.com/) (a search engine for Twitter) the other day, so tried that to see if anyone mentions [#region](http://summize.com/search?q=%23region) or [@codinghorror](http://summize.com/search?q=%40codinghorror) &#8211; which they do, but it&#8217;s a tad disjointed. I couldn&#8217;t follow a conversation.

So I turned to my old friend Google ([how to follow conversations on twitter](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=how+to+follow+conversations+on+twitter)), and found [Quotably](http://quotably.com/)!

Now I can follow the conversation: <http://quotably.com/codinghorror/statuses/811735028>

Quotably is powered by Summize, with some extra jiggery-pokery (and human intervention).

A few months ago I released [the User Control File Tree package for Umbraco](http://blog.leekelleher.com/2009/04/14/umbraco-package-ascx-usercontrol-file-editor-tree/), this allowed developers to edit the front-end code/mark-up in their ASCX user-controls from the Umbraco back-end, (remotely), rather than editing them directly on the server via a text-editor.

Today I have [released the source-code](http://umbracoext.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/35032) on the [Umbraco Extensions project](http://umbracoext.codeplex.com/) (on CodePlex) and created [a project page](http://our.umbraco.org/projects/user-control-file-tree) on the new [Our Umbraco community](http://our.umbraco.org/) website.

If you have any comments, feedback or suggestions &#8211; please feel free to get in touch with me via the Our Umbraco forums.

I received [an email from Pownce](http://www.flickr.com/photos/factoryjoe/2265397377/) this morning, letting me know that they&#8217;ve opened the doors to all! **Yah!** (_oh, the irony_)

I signed up for [Pownce](http://pownce.com/leekelleher/) a couple of months ago&#8230; configured my profile, looked for a few friends &#8230; didn&#8217;t find any &#8230; now what?

At this point I&#8217;m reminded of [Rob Manuel&#8217;s comment about social networks](http://twitter.com/robmanuel/statuses/86540552):

> Social networks are pubs. There&#8217;s little reason to like Facebook if your friends aren&#8217;t there. Anyway, the music is too loud.

Obviously at the time of [Rob](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Manuel)&#8216;s &#8220;tweet&#8221;, Facebook was only just picking up speed in the UK &#8211; now it&#8217;s **THE** place to be on-line (even for the non-geeks). Ringing true, because all your friends are there!

Pownce is an impressive web-app, with a nice slick interface &#8230; I&#8217;d be tempted to use it, only if I had more friends ([billy-no-mates](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=billy+no+mates) me!) &#8211; ([actually I found a few now](http://pownce.com/leekelleher/friends/))

I found another interesting article (by Chris Brogan) about the &#8220;[social networks are like pubs](http://chrisbrogan.com/social-networks-are-your-local-pub/)&#8221; analogy.

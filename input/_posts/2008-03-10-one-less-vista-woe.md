To follow up to my rant a few weeks ago ([More Vista Woes](http://vertino.wordpress.com/2008/01/10/more-vista-woes/) on my old blog), it seems that Microsoft have taken note everyone&#8217;s complaints about the [forced reboot](http://vertino.wordpress.com/2007/10/09/windows-vistas-forced-and-unwanted-reboot/).
  
After putting off my Windows Vista updates for as long as possible, I finally succumbed&#8230;

Once all the updates were installed, I&#8217;m prompted with the same &#8220;_Restart your computer to finish installing important updates_&#8221; message. But now the countdown timer is gone!!!

So at least I don&#8217;t need to worry as much when I go off to make a cup of tea again!

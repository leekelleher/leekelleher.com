I&#8217;ve survived the first week of fatherhood! Even after all the advice from friends and family, books you&#8217;ve read, etc&#8230; **Nothing prepares you for it!** Completely in at the deep-end on the first sleepless night &#8211; no idea what was going on; what time it was; night-turns-into-day-into-night; a total blur! Strangely though, I am loving being a father &#8211; and absolutely smitten with Katelyn!

In other news, there&#8217;s another baby (a project) that [Ben](http://www.bogdind.com/) and [I](http://leekelleher.com/) are getting the ball rolling with&#8230; [Pez](http://code.google.com/p/pez/)!
  
We&#8217;ll tell you all about it soon!

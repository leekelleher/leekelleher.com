I&#8217;ve finally started work on my [zeitgeist](http://leekelleher.com/zeitgeist/) page. My personal projects have been on the back-burner, [as I&#8217;ve (obviously) had other things to think about!](http://www.lee-and-lucy.com/travelblog/2008/02/11/eager-anticipation/)

[Personal Zeitgeist](http://www.creativesynthesis.net/blog/projects/personal-zeitgeist/) is very easy to get up and running, although I have been making a lot of tweaks &#8211; mostly to satisfy my own coding preferences; for example: renaming the `*.inc` files to `*.inc.php` &#8211; so that nobody else can view the source-code. (That&#8217;s been one of my long-term gripes with, the otherwise brilliant, [SimplePie](http://simplepie.org/)).

I&#8217;ll most likely do a lot more customisation to the zeitgeist template/theme before I set it as my default web-page.

Here are a few of the things I want it to do:

  * Act as my OpenID delegate (I haven&#8217;t yet decided who to use as my default OpenID provider &#8211; most likely be WordPress.com)
  * Display a set of links to all my external web-profiles (i.e. [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/leekelleher/), [last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/vertino/), etc.) &#8211; along with corresponding favicons, <acronym title="XHTML Friends Network">XFN</acronym> and <acronym title="Outline Processor Markup Language">OPML</acronym>. (Actually it&#8217;s probably easier to store them as <acronym title="Outline Processor Markup Language">OPML</acronym> in the first place.)
  * I&#8217;m also considering adding some tag cloud functionality &#8211; just to quench my thirst for tagging.
  * Develop a few functions; specifically an email obfuscator (most likely lift the code from wp-includes)

Who knows when I&#8217;ll be able to do all this&#8230; especially when [my](http://www.bodenko.com/) [other](http://www.readysteadybook.com/) [commitments](http://www.lee-and-lucy.com/) are quite demanding! ;-)

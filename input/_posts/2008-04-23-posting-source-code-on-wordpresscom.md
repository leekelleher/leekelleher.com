I feel like a complete n00b &#8230; I&#8217;ve only just found out how to mark-up source-code snippets on WordPress.com

It&#8217;s in their FAQs: [**How do I post source code?**](http://faq.wordpress.com/2007/09/03/how-do-i-post-source-code/)

Essentially you use the short-code: `[sourcecode language='css']...[/sourcecode]`

Here&#8217;s an example:

```csharp
// A "Hello World!" program in C#
class Hello
{
   static void Main()
   {
      System.Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
   }
}
```

I knew about WP.org plugins that did this, but I&#8217;ve been scratching my head on how do this on WP.com for ages now!

Hello and welcome to my new weblog (generously hosted here on [WordPress.com](http://wordpress.com/)).

I&#8217;ve spent the last year (or so) trying to figure out how to best present myself online. My last attempt was over on at [leekelleher.com](http://leekelleher.com/). I had some information about myself, a linklog and details of a [WordPress plugin](http://leekelleher.com/wordpress/plugins/category-cloud-widget/) that I developed.

I found that the linklog became redundant, as it&#8217;s easier for me to use [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/vertino/) for my links/bookmarks.

The Category Cloud widget page is pretty much a mirror of the content hosted over at [WordPress.org&#8217;s Plugins Directory](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/widget-category-cloud/).

Apart from the tidbits of information, my personal site is somewhat lacking&#8230; and definitely overkill to maintain a WordPress installation (with regular updates, patches and security releases &#8211; it was becoming too much of a chore!)

So my latest &#8220;plan&#8221; is to have all my &#8220;user-generated content&#8221; off-site; [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/vertino) (combined with [digg](http://www.digg.com/users/vertino) & [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/shared/08322762871648052302)) for links, [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/leekelleher/) for photos, [last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/vertino/) for music-profiling and (of course) WordPress for the content (blog posts/journals/articles).

I started to look at a PHP script called [Personal Zeitgeist](http://www.creativesynthesis.net/blog/projects/personal-zeitgeist/) to pull everything together. It looks decent enough, so I&#8217;ll see how I get on with it.

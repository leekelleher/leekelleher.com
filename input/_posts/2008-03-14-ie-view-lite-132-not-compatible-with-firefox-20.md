I used all sorts of add-ons and extensions for Firefox, (I&#8217;ll get around to writing a blog post on that soon too). Since I do a lot of web-development, I switch between Firefox and Internet Explorer frequently during a build.

To make this easier, I&#8217;ve been using [Grayson Mixon&#8217;s IE View Lite](http://www.graysonmixon.com/extension/#ieview). But with the latest upgrade (version 1.3.2), it broke in Firefox 2.0! (This made me sad) :-(

I&#8217;d been holding out for the next upgrade &#8211; to see if that would fix the problem&#8230; but nothing came.

So I emailed Grayson to see if there was a potential fix in a future release; which he promptly replied:

> IE View Lite 1.3.2 and 1.3.3 are Firefox 3 only. If you want to continue using Firefox 2, you should use IE View Lite 1.3.1, the only difference being compatibility updates for Firefox 3 that broke backward compatibility.

I&#8217;ve now uninstalled version 1.3.2 &#8211; [reverting back to 1.3.1](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addons/versions/1429) &#8211; and everything is good again! (Thanks Grayson).

It does concern me that support was dropped for [Firefox 2.0](http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=affiliates&id=192858&t=219) in favour of version 3 ([which is still **only** in beta](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-beta.html)) &#8211; cutting out a large proportion of the user-base. But I guess once Firefox 3 has shipped, no one will be bothered anyway.

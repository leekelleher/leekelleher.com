Firstly, congratulations to [Mark and ReadySteadyBook](http://www.readysteadybook.com/Blog.aspx?permalink=20060305023016#comments) on getting an honorable mention in [The Observer&#8217;s Top 50 Players in the World of Books](http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,1723568,00.html). Judging by the order of names, Mark is in fact the **51st Most Important Person in Publishing**!

> Mark Thwaite, founder and editor of [www.readysteadybook.com](http://www.readysteadybook.com/), the UK&#8217;s largest independent literary website. A librarian by trade, Thwaite writes a regular blog attracting up to 3,000 visitors per day.

There is still a lot of work to be done on [ReadySteadyBook](http://www.readysteadybook.com/index.aspx) &#8211; and this recognition from The Observer is a great reward, proving that all our hard work is starting to pay off. The eyes of the publishing world are starting to take notice!

After [helping Bookninja](http://blog.leekelleher.com/2008/02/13/all-hail-the-bookninja-messiah/) with their blog, George kindly sent me some swag, (or &#8220;[thanking him by advertising on his chest](http://www.bookninja.com/?p=3737)&#8220;, as George put it), including a baby-grow (we were expecting Katelyn at the time).

Well, 9 months later, Katelyn fits into the baby-grow (she&#8217;s always been quite a small baby).

I promised [George](http://www.georgemurray.ca/) that I&#8217;d sent him a photo when we got chance. Â It was by pure coincidence that I was wearing a [WordPress hoodie](http://shop.wordpress.net/world/hoodies)! (I&#8217;m such a geek!)

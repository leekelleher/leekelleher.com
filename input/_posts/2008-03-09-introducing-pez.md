In between my many projects (paid and personal) and entering [fatherhood](http://blog.leekelleher.com/2008/02/24/fatherhood/)&#8230; I seem to have found some time to start up an open-source project with [Ben Taylor](http://bogdind.com/), (my old comrade from the [Scream](http://www.stillscreaming.com/) days).

[I&#8217;ve mentioned it](http://blog.leekelleher.com/tag/pez/) a couple of times on my blog recently, but hadn&#8217;t yet got around to introducing it&#8230; then Ben beat me to it!

[So without further ado, here is Ben&#8217;s introduction to Pez!](http://blog.bogdind.com/2008/03/pez-lets-talk-about-it.html)

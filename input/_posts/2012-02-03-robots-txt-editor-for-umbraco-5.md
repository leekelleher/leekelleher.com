First migration of my Umbraco packages to the newly released v5 ([Jupiter](http://umbraco.codeplex.com/releases/view/81440)), I am proud to announce&#8230; [Robots.txt Editor for Umbraco 5](http://our.umbraco.org/projects/developer-tools/robotstxt-editor)!

The majority of the re-development was done during the [#umbWeekend](http://our.umbraco.org/forum/core/general/28098-Umbraco-Weekend-(January-27th)) (last weekend &#8211; 27th January). It was fun to explore the new codebase and APIs for Umbraco v5; creating tree nodes and building the editor.  Then a few evenings this week to polish-up the UI, etc.

For any developers wanting to know more about the code/structure, please do take a look at the [source code](https://bitbucket.org/vertino/robotstxt-editor-for-umbraco).  Any questions, [catch me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/leekelleher).

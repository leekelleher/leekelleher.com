The first time it happened I thought it was odd. After the second time I seemed very weird. Now that it&#8217;s happened a third time &#8211; I&#8217;m just baffled!

What am I rambling on about I hear you ask?!

This&#8230;

This picture on Flickr has been [favourited 3 times](http://www.flickr.com/photos/leekelleher/253429437/favorites/) &#8211; which is nice! However the strange thing going-on here is that those Flickr users (who favourited it) have no photos themselves **and** have **only** favourited my picture!!!

I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s some [SpamBot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spambot) thing happening there? But I just don&#8217;t see the logic in that? (They aren&#8217;t trying to sell/link/spam me)

Any ideas what&#8217;s going on there?

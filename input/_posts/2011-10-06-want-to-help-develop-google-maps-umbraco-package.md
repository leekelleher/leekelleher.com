There are [2 outstanding bugs](https://bitbucket.org/vertino/google-maps-for-umbraco/issues?status=new&status=open) in the [Google Maps for Umbraco package](http://our.umbraco.org/projects/backoffice-extensions/google-maps-datatype). Would you like to help us fix these bugs and [collaborate](http://our.umbraco.org/member/send-collab-request?id=4859) on the project?

My current workload is high and I am aware that there are [2 major bugs](https://bitbucket.org/vertino/google-maps-for-umbraco/issues?status=new&status=open) that need fixing on the Google Map data-type. With my heavy involvement on the [uComponents](http://our.umbraco.org/projects/backoffice-extensions/ucomponents) project, it&#8217;s unlikely I will fix these bugs any time soon, hence the &#8216;call for help&#8217;.

If you have been wanting to get more involved with the [Umbraco community](http://our.umbraco.org/) and earn some [karma](http://our.umbraco.org/wiki/about/ourumbraco-faq), this is an ideal way to get involved.

The [Google Maps data-type source-code](https://bitbucket.org/vertino/google-maps-for-umbraco) is available on my BitBucket repository, feel free to make a fork and submit any pull requests!

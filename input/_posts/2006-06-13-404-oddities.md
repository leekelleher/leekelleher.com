I&#8217;ve been noticing a lot of strange requests in theweb logs for [ReadySteadyBook](http://www.readysteadybook.com/), (which result in 404 errors). Never really thought much of them, but I came across Roger Johansson&#8217;s blog posting about [404 oddities](http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200504/404_oddities/). So I thought I&#8217;d share some of the one&#8217;s I found on [RSB](http://www.readysteadybook.com/Blog.aspx).

A few of them are the same as Roger found: [**/robotsxx.txt**](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%2Frobotsxx.txt); [**/MSOffice/cltreq.asp**](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%2FMSOffice%2Fcltreq.asp); [I&#8217;ve been noticing a lot of strange requests in theweb logs for [ReadySteadyBook](http://www.readysteadybook.com/), (which result in 404 errors).

<!--more-->But some of the others seem more like hacker attempts:

**/cgi-bin/prxjdg.cgi**
:   Google tells me that this is a [ProxyJudge](http://www.google.com/search?q=%2Fcgi-bin%2Fprxjdg.cgi) script. Trying to use the server to disguise their dirty deeds?

**/cgi-bin/ip.cgi**
:   Someone looking for the [Check IP](http://www.networksecuritytoolkit.org/nst/tools/check_ip.html) script? But doesn&#8217;t this just tell you what **your** IP is? _(but I&#8217;ve heard it can be used as [a proxy too](http://www.html.com/forums/apache-web-server/12651-error-log-error-help-am-i.html))_

**/cgi-bin/..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5cwinnt/system32/cmd.exe**
:   Obviously someone trying gain access to the command prompt

**/xxxx.htm**
:   Maybe someone was looking for some tasty literary pornography? _or some Australian lager?!__
  
_ 

**/Spy.txt**
:   I read that there is a keylogger virus called [**BDS/WinSpyer**](http://www.google.com/search?q=BDS%2FWinSpyer), which stores all keystrokes in a file called **Spy.txt**. So someone might be taking a pot-shot at this?

**/Spy**
:   _(same as the spy.txt?)_

**/pcdelisi.htm**
:   [PcDelisi](http://www.google.com/search?q=pcdelisi) is a hacker handle, but I can&#8217;t figure out why someone would be looking for this file?

**/scanned**
:   _(anyone else got any ideas?)_

If you got an ideas/suggestions about these strange 404&#8217;s, let me know&#8230; or share your crazy 404&#8217;s too!?

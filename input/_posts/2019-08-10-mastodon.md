I've signed up to Mastodon. You can find me here: <a href="https://mastodon.social/@leekelleher" rel="me">@leekelleher@mastodon.social</a>.

I've known about Mastodon for a long time, I really like the distributed concept. I hadn't signed-up before as most of my friends were very active on Twitter. It's the "[Social Networks are like Pubs](/2008/02/15/social-networks-are-like-pubs/)" analogy again.

I guess the reason for signing up to Mastodon now is an attempt to step outside of the (perceived) echo chamber and my comfort zone. I remember the excitement of Web 2.0 (circa-2005), trying out any new service that came out. I think that along with [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/), I'm trying to rediscover my excitement for the web, (and controlling my own content and data is a great motivator).

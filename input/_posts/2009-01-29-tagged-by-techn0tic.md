After years of dodging this tag-the-blogger (&#8220;_you&#8217;re it!_&#8220;) memes, it was Dave Kinsella who finally got me. So with pure fear of [a little dead girl climbing out of my TV](http://i99.photobucket.com/albums/l308/VtotheKizzle/lol/the_ring_tv.gif) in 7 days time, I&#8217;ll continue the chain.

If you are tagged you should:

(a) republish these rules

  * Link to your [original tagger](http://webdeveloper2.com/2009/01/tagged-by-fabretti/)(s) and list these rules in your post.
  * Share seven facts about yourself in the post.
  * Tag seven people at the end of your post by leaving their names and the links to their blogs.
  * Let them know they’ve been tagged.

(b) share seven facts about myself

  1. People believe that &#8220;[North by Northwest](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053125/)&#8221; is my favourite film, but it&#8217;s actually &#8220;[The Big Lebowski](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118715/)&#8220;
  2. Known as a Scouser, apart from being born in Liverpool, I have only lived there for 10 years, (I&#8217;m 30-years old).
  3. The remaining 20 years (so far) I have lived in the following places; Northop/North Wales, Hindley/Wigan, Westhoughton/Bolton, Columbo/Sri Lanka, Alicante/Spain and Backwell/Yatton/Bristol.
  4. Although I did a Computer Science degree, I consider myself to be a self-taught developer.
  5. Embarrassingly, I have calculated the VAT wrong 3 times on issued invoices! _&#8212; how difficult can it be?_
  6. I was in a band called [Tremor](http://leekelleher.com/projects/tremor/)&#8230; we played at The Cavern, Matthew Street!
  7. Made a few [short films](http://leekelleher.com/projects/films/), which have been shown at the FACT and regularly on Canvas @ 3345 Parr St.

(c) Tag seven people. This is difficult, I don&#8217;t even know 7 bloggers, but here goes:

  * [Ben Taylor](http://blog.bogdind.com/)
  * [Ross Jones](http://teeko.tumblr.com/)
  * [Kieran Squires](http://www.lynseyandkieran.com/)
  * [Phil Prior](http://www.philprior.co.uk/mylife/)
  * [Ismail Mayat](http://ismail.umbraco.net/)
  * [Simon Dingley](http://blog.prolificnotion.co.uk/)
  * [Dan Higham](http://iamhigham.com/)

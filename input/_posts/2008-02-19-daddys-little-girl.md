[<img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2317/2270392901_6cb20caf5e_m.jpg" alt="Proud Father" style="float:right;margin:0 5px;" height="240" width="224" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/leekelleher/2270392901/ "Proud Father by leekelleher, on Flickr") The past weekend has been an amazing experience for me (and Lucy). After being 12-days overdue, and a 12-hour labour, Lucy gave birth to our beautiful daughter, **[Katelyn Mary Kelleher](http://www.lee-and-lucy.com/travelblog/2008/02/18/katelyn-mary-kelleher/)**!

I&#8217;m still trying to recover from the lack of sleep&#8230; but I can&#8217;t complain too much &#8211; as I wasn&#8217;t the one giving birth!!! (Lucy did fantastic!)

Hopefully they&#8217;ll be coming home from the hospital tomorrow&#8230; I can&#8217;t wait! (apart from doing the house-cleaning! :-( )

We&#8217;ve got an old laptop that we keep under the coffee table, so that we can quickly check IMDb or Wikipedia for mid-conversations things (very geeky I know!)

Since [Katelyn](http://www.lee-and-lucy.com/) arrived, we&#8217;ve been using it for web-cam too.

Yesterday we were having a few problems with voice chat on MSN, so we installed Skype on the laptop.

A couple of clicks later, Skype was installed, all was good. Then about 5 mins later I notice a little Skype toolbar at the top of Firefox! Very very sneaky!!!

There were no options during the install to let me opt-in/out of adding the Firefox Extension! Bad Skype!

I&#8217;m not impressed by companies who try to sneakily install additional software just because you use related software&#8230; _\*cough\*_ [**Apple Safari**](http://www.techmeme.com/080321/p90#a080321p90) _\*cough\*_ (The number of people I&#8217;ve spoke to about it didn&#8217;t know how it got on their computers!)

I do know that Apple at least give you an opt-out of Safari (as they pre-select the checkbox for you) &#8211; but Skype didn&#8217;t even offer that choice!

Regardless of how useful the Skype Firefox Extension is&#8230; I&#8217;ve uninstalled it &#8211; **just because I can!**

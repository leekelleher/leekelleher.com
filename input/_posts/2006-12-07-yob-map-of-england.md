The National Audit Office have compiled [a &#8220;yob map&#8221; of England](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/12/07/nasbo107.xml). [Corby appears to be the worst](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/6215566.stm) &#8211; and Bristol was the place where people were least concerned about bad behaviour. (Looks like my choice to moving to Bristol wasn&#8217;t a bad one!)

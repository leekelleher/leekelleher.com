Last night I released version 2 of the [Robots.txt Editor for Umbraco](http://our.umbraco.org/projects/robotstxt-editor).

Changes & new features:

  * Restructured the package files, they all live in a folder called &#8220;robots-txt&#8221; (still under the /umbraco folder &#8211; but self-contained)
  * Errors are now displayed using the Feedback control (as opposed to the Speech Bubble in the bottom-right corner).
  * Robots.txt editor has buttons for adding new User-Agent and Disallow rules, as well as comment/uncomment functionality.
  * Changed the Robot icon&#8230; courtesy of Mozilla Firefox&#8217;s &#8220;about:robots&#8221; favicon.

Hope you all enjoy the update&#8230; if you come across any bugs or ideas for a future release, [please let me know via the our.umbraco forum](http://our.umbraco.org/projects/robotstxt-editor/feedback).

Next weekend will be the inauguration of [Code Cabin](http://codecab.in). If you haven't heard about Code Cabin yet, it's a weekend retreat for 20 developers; a chance to get together share ideas and hack some code.

If you want to know more about the backstory, [watch the uHangout episode](https://youtu.be/X4J2Qkqhhpw) when [Matt](https://twitter.com/mattbrailsford) announced it back in April.

All the tickets for this Code Cabin sold out before the end of June, but if it sounds like something that you'd like to come along to in future, be sure to [follow @codecabin on Twitter](https://twitter.com/codecabin) for any announcements.

If you want to know what we get up to next week, we'll be tweeting with the hashtag [#codecabin16](https://twitter.com/hashtag/codecabin16)!

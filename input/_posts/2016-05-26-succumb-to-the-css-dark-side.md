Well, it didn't take me long to succumb to the power of the CSS dark side! ;-)

I had a few people comment about my website being "broken" - and my semi-auto reply of "going [back to basics](/2016/03/back-to-basics/)" - but this hasn't bothered me much, it's quite interesting to start a discussion around the idea.

However, I do admit that there are enhancements to be had with appling basic stylings. So I've started a _minimal_ experiement, to explore those enhancements.

Initially I'll apply web-safe fonts and reasonable viewports - _I've already had Google scold me for excessive viewport width on mobile devices!_ The strange part to that is I've tested my blog on phones and tablets, which it renders fine. Still worth exploring the options.

If you have any feedback, I am open to suggestions.

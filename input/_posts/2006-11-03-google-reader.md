It has taken me a long time to actually get around to using RSS feeds properly &#8211; I&#8217;ve known about them (and developed them for other sites) for several years &#8211; but I never could get into the habit of opening a feed-reader everyday&#8230; well, the other day I thought I&#8217;d give [Google&#8217;s Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/) another go (I wasn&#8217;t impressed previously) &#8211; it&#8217;s only been 3 days and I&#8217;m hooked!<!--more-->

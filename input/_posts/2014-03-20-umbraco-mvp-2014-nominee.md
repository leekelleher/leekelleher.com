I&#8217;m honoured to be short-listed for the Umbraco MVP 2014 awards.  I&#8217;ve been fortunate enough to have won the MVP award 3 times before.

In previous years, the nominations have been difficult to vote on, so many great people in the community &#8211; and this year is no exception &#8211; I had a hard time casting my votes!

To cast your votes, go to: <http://our.umbraco.org/people/mvps> &#8211; voting closes at midnight on 10th April 2014. The winners will be announced at [CodeGarden 14](http://codegarden14.com/).

Good luck to all the nominees, you all rock! [#h5yr](http://h5yr.com)

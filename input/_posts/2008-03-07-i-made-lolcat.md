Yes&#8230; **I MADE LOLCAT!**

<div style="text-align:center;">

The photo is from my flickr photostream, [[link](http://www.flickr.com/photos/leekelleher/1447683047/)]; taken whilst we were staying at the farm &#8211; couldn&#8217;t resist taking a snap of these two &#8220;[love cats](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lovecats)&#8221;

Who knows why I end up doing this sort of thing&#8230; it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;ve got time to waste these days!

_**Right, back to work!**_

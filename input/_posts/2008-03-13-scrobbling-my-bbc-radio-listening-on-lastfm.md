A couple of months ago I&#8217;d heard that the [BBC Radio Labs](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/labs/) had developed a desktop widget that [scrobbled the songs you listen to on BBC Radio](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radiolabs/2007/12/scrobbling_your_bbc_radio_list.shtml) (currently only available for Radio 1, Radio 2, 6 Music and 1 Xtra) [[via Last.fm](http://blog.last.fm/2007/12/19/scrobble-what-you-listen-to-on-bbc-radio)]

I&#8217;m not a big fan of gimmicky desktop widgets &#8211;  it&#8217;s bad enough that Vista comes with them as default &#8211; some people love them, some hate them&#8230; I just prefer less clutter on my desktop!

The other day I was listening to a lot of Radio 1&#8230; to which I thought it would be nice to have these songs scrobbled on [my Last.fm profile](http://www.last.fm/user/vertino/).  So I bit the bullet and downloaded [Yahoo! Widgets](http://widgets.yahoo.com/) and the [BBC Radio + Last.fm widget](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/labs/bbc_radio_last_fm_widget/yahoo/bbc_radio_last_fm.widget). ([OS X widget is also available](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/labs/bbc_radio_last_fm_widget/osx/bbc_radio_last_fm.wdgt.zip))

So far I&#8217;ve been fairly impressed with the way it works.  That is, once I&#8217;d hidden all the gimmicky widgets &#8211; _yes I already have a clock in my taskbar_; the weather outside is cold and wet&#8230; _I know this already, **this is England after all!**_

Today is [World Book Day](http://www.worldbookday.com/), along with a customary plug-link to [ReadySteadyBook](http://www.readysteadybook.com/), (and [BLB](http://www.britlitblogs.com/)), ;-) I&#8217;ve just been reading about [how to recognise a literary expert bluffer](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6404297.stm).

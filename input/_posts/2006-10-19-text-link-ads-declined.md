Just got an email from the guys at [Text Link Ads](http://www.text-link-ads.com/?ref=37673) saying that my submission for this site ([leekelleher.com](http://leekelleher.com/)) has been declined! :( <!--more-->

I know I&#8217;m not the coolest kid on the block, but I have got [an Alexa ranking of **421,850**!](http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=&url=leekelleher.com) (how that happened &#8211; I do not know!)

Today is Firefox 3 Download Day! [Mozilla are hoping to set a Guinness World Record for most software downloads in 24 hours.](http://www.spreadfirefox.com/en-US/worldrecord/)

At the time of writing, over 1.2 million people have pledged to download Firefox 3 on the Download Day!

This is a first attempt of this record, so there is no number to beat. But Mozilla want to outdo the number of Firefox 2 downloads on its launch day, which was 1.6 million! The aim is 5 million+!

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Update:</strong></span> It&#8217;s official, Firefox 3 set a Guinness World Record for the most software downloads in 24 hours. Reaching **8,002,530** downloads! [They even give me a certificate for taking part](http://leekelleher.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/download-day-2008.pdf "Firefox 3 - Download Day 2008") &#8230; feels like I&#8217;m back at primary school! :-D ([_so proud!_](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQr-kHK6Kvc))

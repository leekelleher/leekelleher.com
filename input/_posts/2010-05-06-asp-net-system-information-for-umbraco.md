Released a new [Umbraco](http://umbraco.org/) package today, that integrates the [ASP.NET System Information Prober](http://code.google.com/p/aspnetsysinfo/) into the Umbraco back-office.

**What is the ASP.NET System Information Prober?** It is a single page that tries to get as much useful hosting information about your web-server. The concept is similar to PHP&#8217;s native [phpinfo()](http://php.net/manual/en/function.phpinfo.php) function.

Installing the package will add a new node tree to the developer section.

Here is a quick demo video: <http://screenr.com/2YC>

You can download the [ASP.NET System Information for Umbraco](http://our.umbraco.org/projects/aspnet-system-information) package from the [Our Umbraco](http://our.umbraco.org/) community site.

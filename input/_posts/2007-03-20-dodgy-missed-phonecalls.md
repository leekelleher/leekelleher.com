Just noticed that I had a missed call on my mobile from [02920368792](http://technorati.com/tag/02920368792), (I didn&#8217;t even hear it ring). [So I googled the number](http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=02920368792). I found out it [a Spam/Cold-Caller number](http://vinlai.com/blog/cold-callers-spam-numbers.html).

Now I&#8217;m a bit pee&#8217;d off, as yesterday I signed up for [TSB&#8217;s text message alerts](http://www.lloydstsb.com/internet_banking/sms_text_alerts.asp) &#8211; coincidence or what?

Following up on my recent post of using [Robots.txt with Umbraco](http://blog.leekelleher.com/2009/07/07/robots-txt-for-use-with-umbraco/), I decided that it would be nice to be able to edit the robots.txt directly from the Umbraco back-end.  (Also I wanted to play a bit more with the BaseTree/ITree classes).

This afternoon I had a few hours to spare &#8211; actually I was procrastinating on another job, (don&#8217;t tell my client &#8211; I&#8217;ll finish it off later tonight) &#8211; so I got down to some coding.

The [source-code is available](http://umbracoext.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/35482) on the [Umbraco Extensions project](http://umbracoext.codeplex.com/) (on CodePlex) and created [a project page](http://our.umbraco.org/projects/developer-tools/robotstxt-editor) on the new [Our Umbraco community](http://our.umbraco.org/) website. (Don&#8217;t forget to give it some karma points! ;-p)

[A direct download to the package installer (zip) is available here.](http://our.umbraco.org/media/wiki/5402/633837309506210000_Robotstxt_Editor_10.zip)

Very special thanks to [Dave Kinsella](http://webdeveloper2.com/) for providing the [Robot icon](http://twitpic.com/b01nb)  <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-149" title="robot icon" src="http://leekelleher.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/18477911.png" alt="robot icon" width="16" height="16" />&#8211; although I know Dave, it was great [proof that Twitter really does work!](http://twitter.com/leekelleher/statuses/2738891885) (Thanks to [Dan](http://twitter.com/DanielBowden) too for his [Johnny 5](http://twitpic.com/b03gf) attempt!  <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-150" title="18480255" src="http://leekelleher.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/18480255.png" alt="18480255" width="16" height="15" />&#8211; Here was [my attempt](http://twitpic.com/b06dk) too!  <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-151" title="18484040" src="http://leekelleher.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/18484040.png" alt="18484040" width="16" height="16" />)

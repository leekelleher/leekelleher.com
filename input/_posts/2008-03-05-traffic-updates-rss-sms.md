Since moving down to Bristol, I have been subscribing to the [Underscore mailing list](http://www.under-score.org.uk/) &#8211; of which I&#8217;m guilty of non-participation. One of the threads today made me realise the potential of **user empowerment** using &#8220;Web 2.0&#8221; services and technologies.

The thread was called &#8220;[RSS -> SMS](http://www.under-score.org.uk/pipermail/underscore/2008-March/070472.html)&#8220;, Andy wrote:

The suggestion of [Twitter&#8217;s](http://twitter.com/) SMS notifications was made, utilising the (very good) [twitterfeed](http://twitterfeed.com/) service, (which I used for both [RSB](http://twitter.com/readysteadybook) and [BLB](http://twitter.com/britlitblogs) tweets).

The UK Traffic information is provided by [the Highways Agency in RSS format](http://www.highways.gov.uk/traffic/11278.aspx) &#8211; which was routed through [Yahoo Pipes to filter items containing information about the M5](http://pipes.yahoo.com/andydavies/m5traffic).

It was later found out that there is already [a dedicated RSS feed for the M5](http://www.highways.gov.uk/rssfeed/M5.xml), thus making the Yahoo Pipes method redundant. However the issue here isn&#8217;t about the range of RSS feeds and knowing what do with them&#8230; it&#8217;s about everyday people using openly available data to provide useful personalised information.

Sure, it&#8217;s mostly web-savvy developers doing this at the moment &#8211; yet as the web technologies evolve, we&#8217;ll start to see more personalised services that anyone can use.

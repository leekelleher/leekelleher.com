## Is this site broken?

When I decided to reboot my website, I spent some time researching all the usual things - which software to use, pick a design/theme. I got myself stuck in a rut; indecision!

Some weeks later I was reading a post on [Micah Godbolt's blog](https://micah.codes/); the striking thing about Micah's blog is the "default-ness". It didn't have any CSS, nor JavaScript, no web-fonts... just pure plain old HTML.  I became inspired.

Micah writes about this in much better detail, go read his post: <https://micah.codes/hello-world/>


## My reasoning

For me, I was wasting time browsing designs/themes, I didn't want to become a slave of modern web-design - using the latest CSS framework, with a dozen dependencies. I wanted to take back my website, I wanted to go back to basics!

In time I may introduce some styling, tweak the viewport width or apply a reasonable typography, but for now I'd like to focus on the semantics of the markup - to lay a solid foundation to build on.

As for JavaScript, I'm less worried about Google Analytics; truth be told, I hardly study the traffic or data. It doesn't motivate me.  I'm likely to reintroduce the Disqus commenting system very soon.

In the meantime, if you have any questions for me, either [tweet me](https://twitter.com/leekelleher) or [raise an issue on my GitHub repo for this website](https://github.com/leekelleher/leekelleher.com/issues).

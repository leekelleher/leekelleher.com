Hey there! If you are planning on getting in touch with me for Umbraco/uComponents support, please keep in mind that I do contribute to those projects in my own free (limited) time.

If you appreciate my support, or would like to buy me a beer &#8211; please consider sending a little thank you from [my Amazon wishlist](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/registry/wishlist/24YZIUZ0849S4/?ie=UTF8&camp=3194&creative=21334&linkCode=shr&tag=leekelleher-21), (or maybe [something nice for my kids?](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/registry/wishlist/BWH1F21SVTPT/?ie=UTF8&camp=3194&creative=21334&linkCode=shr&tag=leekelleher-21)) #h5yr

For professional Umbraco services, please do [get in touch with me via Umbrella](http://umbrellainc.co.uk/), (we are [Umbraco Certified Partners](http://umbrellainc.co.uk/)).

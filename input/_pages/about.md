Hello, I'm Lee Kelleher, welcome to my website. Born in Liverpool, raised around the north-west of England. I have also lived abroad, in Sri Lanka and Spain. When I'm not trying to think of things to say about myself, I usually [write code](https://github.com/leekelleher), [travel around](http://www.lee-and-lucy.com/), take [photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/leekelleher/) (and occasionally [play music](https://soundcloud.com/leekelleher), or make a [short film](https://www.youtube.com/user/vertino), or even a [comic book](http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/vertino)).

Amongst my other work, I am a five-time [Umbraco](https://umbraco.com) MVP (from 2010 through to 2015), and developer of [many Umbraco packages/projects](https://our.umbraco.org/member/3042#created).

If you are looking for my [Umbraco packages](https://our.umbraco.org/member/3042#created), please visit the [Our Umbraco](https://our.umbraco.org/) community website. For my very old WordPress plugins (specifically the [Category Cloud widget](http://leekelleher.com/wordpress/plugins/category-cloud-widget/)), you can [find them here](http://leekelleher.com/wordpress/plugins/).

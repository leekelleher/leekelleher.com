Hello, I'm Lee Kelleher, welcome to my website.

Quick bio: born in Liverpool, raised around north-west England. Lived abroad, in Sri Lanka and Spain. Current past times are [writing code](https://github.com/leekelleher) and [playing bass guitar](https://thedysfunctions.uk). Before kids, I did a bit of [travelling around](https://www.lee-and-lucy.com), made a few [short films](https://www.youtube.com/user/vertino), and even dabbled in writing a [comic book](http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/vertino).

Professionally, I build websites using Umbraco CMS. I co-founded [Umbrella, an Umbraco consultancy agency](https://umbrellainc.co.uk), I am a ten time [Umbraco](https://umbraco.com) MVP (from 2010 through to 2020), and developer of [many Umbraco packages/projects](https://our.umbraco.com/members/leekelleher/#created).

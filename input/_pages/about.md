Hello, I'm Lee Kelleher, welcome to my website. Quick bio: born in Liverpool, raised around north-west England. Lived abroad, in Sri Lanka and Spain. Current past times are [writing code](https://github.com/leekelleher), [playing bass guitar (in a local covers band)](https://thedysfunctions.uk/). In the past I've done a bit of [travelling around](https://www.lee-and-lucy.com/), made a few [short films](https://www.youtube.com/user/vertino), and even dabbled in writing a [comic book](http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/vertino).

Amongst my other work, I am an eight-time [Umbraco](https://umbraco.com) MVP (from 2010 through to 2018), and developer of [many Umbraco packages/projects](https://our.umbraco.org/member/3042#created).

If you would like to help support any of the Umbraco packages I develop, please do consider [becoming an UMCO Patron](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=4312563).

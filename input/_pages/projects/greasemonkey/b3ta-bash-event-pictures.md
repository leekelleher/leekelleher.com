Following on from the [B3ta Bash Tags](http://leekelleher.com/projects/greasemonkey/b3ta-bash-tags/) user-script that I recently wrote&#8230; [brooza](http://www.b3ta.com/users/profile.php?id=37341) asked if I&#8217;d be interested in making a user-script that displayed the [tagged photos from Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/b3ta%3Abash%3D*/) on the [B3ta Bash](http://www.b3ta.com/calendar/) event page.

Well I did just that&#8230; I&#8217;ve knocked up a greasemonkey script that inserts photos from Flickr into the B3ta events page. To install youâ€™ll need [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748) and this script: <http://userscripts.org/scripts/source/10922.user.js>

For more information about this user-script, please visit [userscripts.org](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/10922)

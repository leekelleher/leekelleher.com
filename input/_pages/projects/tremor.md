During 1999 and 2000, I was part of a rock band called **Tremor**.

Previously I&#8217;d been playing around with the bass and guitars for a couple of years, but never really got my act together to join a band until I met Jeff Moore. Jeff invited me around to Paul Hagan&#8217;s house for jam-session &#8211; which turned out to be an audition! We went for a pint afterwards, and asked me to the Bassist.

Hagan was still in his band, Keegan, who had no idea that he was having an &#8216;affair&#8217; with Tremor. Which we ended up stealing Graeme (the Drummer) from. :-|

We spent a solid six-months practising and rehearsing, we wanted to be as tight as possible. Then in early-2000 we were ready to gig!

During our rehearsal period, there were personal tensions between Jeff and Paul &#8230; (which remain personal) &#8230; ultimately Paul decided to leave the band. :-( Leaving us without a rhythm-guitarist. Luckily, Jeff knew of a young demon guitarist, Ian (who I also knew of via my sister). So we were back on track!

After a few more gigs, we started to get calls from promotion agencies for demo CDs and even had an offer to support a touring band. However Jeff had a few personal things going on, and decided to call it a day! (I was in the middle of my final year at Uni, so it wasn&#8217;t great timing for me either). So that was the end of the mighty Tremor!

We only got to play 4 live gigs in total before we split up, we actually headlined all of them, they were: [The Picket](http://www.savethepicket.com/) (twice); The LoMAX and [The Cavern Club](http://www.cavern-liverpool.co.uk/cavernclub/)

Tremor were: Jeff Moore, Graeme Bourque, Lee Kelleher, Ian Dunn and [Paul Hagan](http://www.thescales.co.uk/).

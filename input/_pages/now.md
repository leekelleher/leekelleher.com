## What I'm doing now?

* Generally dealing with life in 2020, COVID-19 lockdown and Brexit shenanigans.
* Release a single (and video) with my "dad band", [The Dysfunctions](https://thedysfunctions.uk/).
* Released a beta version of my new Umbraco package, [Contentment](https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment).
* ...and coming up with new buiness ideas within [Umbrella](https://umbrellainc.co.uk/).

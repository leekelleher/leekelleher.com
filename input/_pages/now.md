## What I'm doing now?

* Playing bass in a local covers band, (_after 17 years since I was last in a band_).
* Bought a new house, _so, up to my neck in paperwork, mortgages and logistics_.
* Involved with a multitude of Carlsberg projects, (_on [Umbraco Cloud](https://umbraco.com/)_).
* Struggling to find time for developing new Umbraco packages.

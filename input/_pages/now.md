## What I'm doing now?

* Playing bass guitar in [a local covers band](https://thedysfunctions.uk/).
* Preparing (slowly) for [CodeCabin 18](https://codecab.in/).
* Taking a little time out from Carlsberg projects.
* Tinkering around with new [UMCO / Umbraco packages](https://github.com/umco).
* Still getting the (new) house in order, (moved in 12 months ago).

In recent years, I&#8217;ve been known to have dabbled my fingers in many pies. I played bass in a band; produced a few short films; developed numerous web-sites and even helped out with Kieran&#8217;s comic-book projects.

This section of my site gives you a little look at some of those projects. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to [get in touch](/contact/).

## [Greasemonkey](/projects/greasemonkey/)

Recently I have developed a few <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748">Greasemonkey</a> user-scripts, mainly focusing on the use of <a href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/api/discuss/72157594497877875/">machine-tags on Flickr</a>.

## [Short Films](/projects/films/)

Between 2002 and 2004, <a href="http://www.kigo.co.uk/">Kieran</a> and I made a few short films.

We had a blast and learnt loads about digital film-making&#8230; plus we got some of our films shown at the local cinema!

## [Tremor](/projects/tremor/)

During 1999/2000, I was in a band called Tremor&#8230;

Some say that we could have got signed, but unfortunately we crashed and burnt before we truly got started! It&#8217;s a shame, but we had good times and no regrets!

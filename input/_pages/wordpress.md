Since using [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) as a blogging platform, I have developed a few plugins to help aid the development of the websites I have built. Officially I do not support these plugins, however if you do have some difficulty getting with them, [drop me an email](http://leekelleher.com/contact/) and I&#8217;ll try to help out.

All my plugins work for version of WordPress I am currently using (at the point of writing this is 2.1).

The latest version of each plugin, which include any bug fixes, can be found in the official [WordPress Plugins Directory](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/).

<!-- p>If you would like to show your gratitude there are donate and wishlist links on each of the plugin pages.</p -->

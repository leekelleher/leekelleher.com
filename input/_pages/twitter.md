Hello! Thanks for following the link from my Twitter profile. I guess you'd like to know a little more about me and [my Twitter account](https://twitter.com/leekelleher)?

In recent years I have built up a reputation as an [Umbraco specialist](https://umbrellainc.co.uk). I am involved with the Umbraco project at many levels, from organising local events/meet-ups, developing packages and contributing to the core product. So the majority of my tweets will be on [Umbraco](https://our.umbraco.com) related subjects.

If you aren't interested in Umbraco, ASP.NET, C#, or general web-development, then please do feel free to unfollow me. As for who I follow on Twitter, this depends on my mood and current interests &ndash; if I don't follow you back, it is nothing personal.

Of course, I'm human too &ndash; so if you are family, friend, or we've meet in "real life" &hellip; then you are welcome to add me as a friend on [Facebook](https://leekelleher.com/facebook); where I mostly post cute photos of my kids and I'll never mention programming!

If you are looking to get in contact with me for my professional Umbraco services, please get do [get in touch with me via my company, Umbrella](https://umbrellainc.co.uk).

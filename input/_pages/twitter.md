Hello! Thanks for following the link from my Twitter profile. I guess you&#8217;d like to know a little more about me and [my Twitter account](https://twitter.com/leekelleher)?

In recent years I have built up a reputation as an [Umbraco specialist](http://umbrellainc.co.uk). I am involved with the Umbraco project at many levels, from organising local events/meet-ups, developing packages and contributing to the core product. So the majority of my tweets will be on [Umbraco](http://our.umbraco.org) related subjects.

If you aren&#8217;t interested in Umbraco, ASP.NET, C#, or general web-development, then please do feel free to unfollow me. As for who I follow on Twitter, this depends on my mood and current interests &#8211; if I don&#8217;t follow you back, it is nothing personal.

Of course, I&#8217;m am human too &#8211; so if you are family, friend, or we&#8217;ve meet in &#8220;real life&#8221; &#8230; then you are welcome to add me as a friend on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/leekelleher); where I mostly post cute photos of my kids and I&#8217;ll never ever mention programming!

If you are looking to get in contact with me for my professional Umbraco services, please get do [get in touch with me via my company, Umbrella](http://umbrellainc.co.uk).

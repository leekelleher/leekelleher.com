I've survived the first week of fatherhood! Even after all the advice from friends and family, books you've read, etc... <strong>Nothing prepares you for it!</strong> Completely in at the deep-end on the first sleepless night - no idea what was going on; what time it was; night-turns-into-day-into-night; a total blur!  Strangely though, I am loving being a father - and absolutely smitten with Katelyn!

In other news, there's another baby (a project) that <a href="http://www.bogdind.com/">Ben</a> and <a href="http://leekelleher.com/">I</a> are getting the ball rolling with... <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pez/">Pez</a>!
We'll tell you all about it soon!

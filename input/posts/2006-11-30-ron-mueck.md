# Ron Mueck

Just had an email forward from my Mum, showing photos of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Mueck">Ron Mueck</a>'s <a href="http://www.artmolds.com/ali/halloffame/ron_muek.htm">sculptures</a> - brilliant! (I'd never heard of him before, but I loved <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth_%28film%29">Labyrinth</a> as a kid!)

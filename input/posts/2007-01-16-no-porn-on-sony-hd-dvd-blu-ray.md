# No Porn On Sony HD-DVD Blu-ray?

I thought Sony would have learnt from their mistakes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betamax">Betamax</a>... but it seems that <a href="http://www.sgknox.com/2007/01/11/no-porn-on-blu-ray/">Sony doesn't allow XXX-rated movies to be released on Blu-ray!</a>

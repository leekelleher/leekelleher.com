# One Less Vista Woe

To follow up to my rant a few weeks ago (<a href="http://vertino.wordpress.com/2008/01/10/more-vista-woes/">More Vista Woes</a> on my old blog), it seems that Microsoft have taken note everyone's complaints about the <a href="http://vertino.wordpress.com/2007/10/09/windows-vistas-forced-and-unwanted-reboot/">forced reboot</a>.
After putting off my Windows Vista updates for as long as possible, I finally succumbed...

Once all the updates were installed, I'm prompted with the same "<i>Restart your computer to finish installing important updates</i>" message. But now the countdown timer is gone!!!

So at least I don't need to worry as much when I go off to make a cup of tea again!

# Strange goings-on

The first time it happened I thought it was odd. After the second time I seemed very weird. Now that it's happened a third time - I'm just baffled!

What am I rambling on about I hear you ask?!

This...

<img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/96/253429437_a8810c0172_m.jpg" alt="My Celebrity Look-Alikes" width="209" height="240" /></a>

This picture on Flickr has been <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leekelleher/253429437/favorites/">favourited 3 times</a> - which is nice! However the strange thing going-on here is that those Flickr users (who favourited it) have no photos themselves <strong>and</strong> have <strong>only</strong> favourited my picture!!!

I'm sure there's some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spambot">SpamBot</a> thing happening there? But I just don't see the logic in that? (They aren't trying to sell/link/spam me)

Any ideas what's going on there?

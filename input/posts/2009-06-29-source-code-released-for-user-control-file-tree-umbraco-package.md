# Source Code Released for User Control File Tree Umbraco Package

A few months ago I released <a href="http://blog.leekelleher.com/2009/04/14/umbraco-package-ascx-usercontrol-file-editor-tree/">the User Control File Tree package for Umbraco</a>, this allowed developers to edit the front-end code/mark-up in their ASCX user-controls from the Umbraco back-end, (remotely), rather than editing them directly on the server via a text-editor.

Today I have <a href="http://umbracoext.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/35032">released the source-code</a> on the <a href="http://umbracoext.codeplex.com/">Umbraco Extensions project</a> (on CodePlex) and created <a href="http://our.umbraco.org/projects/user-control-file-tree">a project page</a> on the new <a href="http://our.umbraco.org/">Our Umbraco community</a> website.

If you have any comments, feedback or suggestions - please feel free to get in touch with me via the Our Umbraco forums.

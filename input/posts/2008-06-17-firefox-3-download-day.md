<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/node&amp;id=192858&amp;t=264"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/files/images/affiliates_banners/dday_badge_fox.png" border="0" alt="Download Day" /></a></p>

Today is Firefox 3 Download Day!  <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/en-US/worldrecord/">Mozilla are hoping to set a Guinness World Record for most software downloads in 24 hours.</a>

At the time of writing, over 1.2 million people have pledged to download Firefox 3 on the Download Day!

This is a first attempt of this record, so there is no number to beat.  But Mozilla want to outdo the number of Firefox 2 downloads on its launch day, which was 1.6 million!  The aim is 5 million+!

# Yob Map of England

The National Audit Office have compiled <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/12/07/nasbo107.xml">a "yob map" of England</a>. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/6215566.stm">Corby appears to be the worst</a> - and Bristol was the place where people were least concerned about bad behaviour. (Looks like my choice to moving to Bristol wasn't a bad one!)

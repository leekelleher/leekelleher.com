# Daddy's Little Girl

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leekelleher/2270392901/" title="Proud Father by leekelleher, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2317/2270392901_6cb20caf5e_m.jpg" alt="Proud Father" style="float:right;margin:0 5px;" height="240" width="224" /></a> The past weekend has been an amazing experience for me (and Lucy).  After being 12-days overdue, and a 12-hour labour, Lucy gave birth to our beautiful daughter, <b><a href="http://www.lee-and-lucy.com/travelblog/2008/02/18/katelyn-mary-kelleher/">Katelyn Mary Kelleher</a></b>!

I'm still trying to recover from the lack of sleep... but I can't complain too much - as I wasn't the one giving birth!!! (Lucy did fantastic!)

Hopefully they'll be coming home from the hospital tomorrow... I can't wait! (apart from doing the house-cleaning! :-( )

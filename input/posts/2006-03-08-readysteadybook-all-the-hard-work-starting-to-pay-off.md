# ReadySteadyBook - All the hard work starting to pay off?

Firstly, congratulations to <a href="http://www.readysteadybook.com/Blog.aspx?permalink=20060305023016#comments">Mark and ReadySteadyBook</a> on getting an honorable mention in <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,1723568,00.html">The Observer's Top 50 Players in the World of Books</a>.  Judging by the order of names, Mark is in fact the <strong>51st Most Important Person in Publishing</strong>!
<blockquote>Mark Thwaite, founder and editor of <a href="http://www.readysteadybook.com/">www.readysteadybook.com</a>, the UK's largest independent literary website. A librarian by trade, Thwaite writes a regular blog attracting up to 3,000 visitors per day.</blockquote>
There is still a lot of work to be done on <a href="http://www.readysteadybook.com/index.aspx">ReadySteadyBook</a> - and this recognition from The Observer is a great reward, proving that all our hard work is starting to pay off. The eyes of the publishing world are starting to take notice!

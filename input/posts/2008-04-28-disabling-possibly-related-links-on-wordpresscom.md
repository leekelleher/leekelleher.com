# Disabling Possibly Related Links on WordPress.com

When WordPress.com introduced <a href="http://wordpress.com/blog/2006/12/29/snap-to-it/">Snap Preview</a> on our blogs (or is that their blogs?) at the end of 2006, I wasn't impressed - it felt intrusive - like a JavaScript pop-up for Web 2.0! (Just given a different name).  So I disabled it straight-away.

A few days ago, the WP.com team introduced a new feature "<a href="http://wordpress.com/blog/2008/04/25/possibly-an-announcement/">Possibly Related Posts</a>".  At first I thought this was a great idea for finding similar content - but then I realised that it could become a mechanism for sploggers to inject links on your blog.  (Obviously this feature is restricted to WP.com blogs only - which itself raises a few questions).

The other week I had a bit of a rant about how <a href="http://blog.leekelleher.com/2008/04/14/sneaky-skype-installing-firefox-extension/">Skype sneakily installed a Firefox Extension</a> and that they should have provided an opt-in.  <a href="http://internetducttape.com/2008/04/27/fixing-the-wordpresscom-possibly-related-feature/">There</a> <a href="http://larvatusprodeo.net/2008/04/28/wordpresscom-enables-another-new-feature-to-far-from-universal-acclaim/">has been a</a> <a href="http://amnesiablog.wordpress.com/2008/04/28/how-to-turn-off-wordpress-related-links/">similar</a> <a href="http://danamckay.wordpress.com/2008/04/28/add-the-features-your-users-want-not-the-features-you-want-them-to-have/">backlash</a> <a href="http://shewhostumbles.wordpress.com/2008/04/26/warning-the-new-wordpress-feature-is-utter-trollbait/">about this</a> <a href="http://saltedlithium.wordpress.com/2008/04/28/possibly-related-posts/">new</a> <a href="http://williamtildesley.wordpress.com/2008/04/28/how-dare-wordpress/">WP.com</a> <a href="http://akhomeschoolfun.wordpress.com/2008/04/27/possibly-related-posts/">feature</a>!

The blogosphere's very own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saraswati">Saraswathi</a>, the wise Lorelle has <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2008/04/26/alert-possibly-related-posts-feature-on-wordpresscom-blogs/">wrote about her feelings on the matter and how to disable this new feature</a>.

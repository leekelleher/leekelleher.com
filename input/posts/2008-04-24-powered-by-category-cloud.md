# "Powered by Category Cloud"

I've just installed <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/4106">Operator</a> - a Firefox extension that highlights microformatted data on web pages.

So far I haven't noticed any performance issues, and it's been playing nicely with all my other Firefox extensions.

As a web developer, Operator makes me want to add more semantic mark-up to my websites, (which I already try to do).  This extension will make it easier for testing purposes.

I decided to <a href="http://www.kaply.com/weblog/operator/">read more about the extension on the developer's blog</a> - to which I was pleasantly surprised to find that it uses my <a href="http://leekelleher.com/wordpress/plugins/category-cloud-widget/">Category Cloud widget</a> (plug-in for WordPress).  Along with a kudos-link back to my personal website. (<a href="http://www.kaply.com/">Thanks Mike!</a>) :-D

A while ago I was curious to how many people were using my Category Cloud widget plug-in, so I added an opt-out "powered by" link.  This way I could check my referrals or Google results count for <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22--+Powered+by+Category+Cloud%22">"Powered by Category Cloud"</a>.

I've been amazed by the outcome of this.  I honestly thought that everyone would opt-out of the link, yet they didn't!  So now my PageRank has increased; I'm in the <a href="http://technorati.com/blogs/leekelleher.com?reactions">Technorati Top 10K</a> (which I definitely don't deserve!); and I get a steady flow of traffic (low, but consistent).

I've tried to support the Category Cloud widget as best I can... so maybe it's good karma?

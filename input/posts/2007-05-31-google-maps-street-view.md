# Google Maps Street View

Google have added a new feature on their <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/">maps</a>... Panoramic street views! <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=Golden+Gate+Bridge,+San+Francisco&sll=37.834056,-122.471895&sspn=0.045621,0.080338&ie=UTF8&om=1&layer=c&cbll=37.811104,-122.477591&cbp=1,33.6754416197748,0.518817153791277,3&ll=37.819718,-122.475801&spn=0.022815,0.040169&z=15">Check this one from the Golden Gate Bridge - could it be a tourist asking for directions? or maybe it's a secret spy meeting?</a> [via <a href="http://www.webdeveloper2.com/blog/2007/05/google-maps-street-view.html">Dave</a>]

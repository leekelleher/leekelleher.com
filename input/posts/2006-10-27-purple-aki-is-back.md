# Purple Aki is back

I always thought that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Aki">Purple Aki</a> was an urban legend... <a href="http://www.urbanomic.com/MT/sphaleotas/archives/000039.html">but he's not</a>, and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/6087922.stm">he's just been release from jail!</a> [via the BBC]

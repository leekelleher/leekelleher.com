# Scrobbling my BBC Radio listening on Last.fm

A couple of months ago I'd heard that the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/labs/">BBC Radio Labs</a> had developed a desktop widget that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radiolabs/2007/12/scrobbling_your_bbc_radio_list.shtml">scrobbled the songs you listen to on BBC Radio</a> (currently only available for Radio 1, Radio 2, 6 Music and 1 Xtra) [<a href="http://blog.last.fm/2007/12/19/scrobble-what-you-listen-to-on-bbc-radio">via Last.fm</a>]

I'm not a big fan of gimmicky desktop widgets -  it's bad enough that Vista comes with them as default - some people love them, some hate them... I just prefer less clutter on my desktop!

The other day I was listening to a lot of Radio 1... to which I thought it would be nice to have these songs scrobbled on <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/vertino/">my Last.fm profile</a>.  So I bit the bullet and downloaded <a href="http://widgets.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Widgets</a> and the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/labs/bbc_radio_last_fm_widget/yahoo/bbc_radio_last_fm.widget">BBC Radio + Last.fm widget</a>. (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/labs/bbc_radio_last_fm_widget/osx/bbc_radio_last_fm.wdgt.zip">OS X widget is also available</a>)

So far I've been fairly impressed with the way it works.  That is, once I'd hidden all the gimmicky widgets - <i>yes I already have a clock in my taskbar</i>; the weather outside is cold and wet... <i>I know this already, <b>this is England after all!</b></i>

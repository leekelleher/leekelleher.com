# Dodgy Missed Phonecalls

Just noticed that I had a missed call on my mobile from <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/02920368792">02920368792</a>, (I didn't even hear it ring).  <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=02920368792">So I googled the number</a>. I found out it <a href="http://vinlai.com/blog/cold-callers-spam-numbers.html">a Spam/Cold-Caller number</a>.

Now I'm a bit pee'd off, as yesterday I signed up for <a href="http://www.lloydstsb.com/internet_banking/sms_text_alerts.asp">TSB's text message alerts</a> - coincidence or what?

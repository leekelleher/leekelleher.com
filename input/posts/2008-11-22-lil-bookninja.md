# Lil' Bookninja

After <a href="http://blog.leekelleher.com/2008/02/13/all-hail-the-bookninja-messiah/">helping Bookninja</a> with their blog, George kindly sent me some swag, (or "<a href="http://www.bookninja.com/?p=3737">thanking him by advertising on his chest</a>", as George put it), including a baby-grow (we were expecting Katelyn at the time).

Well, 9 months later, Katelyn fits into the baby-grow (she's always been quite a small baby).

I promised <a href="http://www.georgemurray.ca/">George</a> that I'd sent him a photo when we got chance. Â It was by pure coincidence that I was wearing a <a href="http://shop.wordpress.net/world/hoodies">WordPress hoodie</a>! (I'm such a geek!)

# Personal Zeitgeist

I've finally started work on my <a href="http://leekelleher.com/zeitgeist/">zeitgeist</a> page.  My personal projects have been on the back-burner, <a href="http://www.lee-and-lucy.com/travelblog/2008/02/11/eager-anticipation/">as I've (obviously) had other things to think about!</a>

<a href="http://www.creativesynthesis.net/blog/projects/personal-zeitgeist/">Personal Zeitgeist</a> is very easy to get up and running, although I have been making a lot of tweaks - mostly to satisfy my own coding preferences; for example: renaming the <code>*.inc</code> files to <code>*.inc.php</code> - so that nobody else can view the source-code. (That's been one of my long-term gripes with, the otherwise brilliant, <a href="http://simplepie.org/">SimplePie</a>).

I'll most likely do a lot more customisation to the zeitgeist template/theme before I set it as my default web-page.

Here are a few of the things I want it to do:
<ul>
	<li>Act as my OpenID delegate (I haven't yet decided who to use as my default OpenID provider - most likely be WordPress.com)</li>
	<li>Display a set of links to all my external web-profiles (i.e. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leekelleher/">flickr</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/vertino/">last.fm</a>, etc.) - along with corresponding favicons, <acronym title="XHTML Friends Network">XFN</acronym> and <acronym title="Outline Processor Markup Language">OPML</acronym>. (Actually it's probably easier to store them as <acronym title="Outline Processor Markup Language">OPML</acronym> in the first place.)</li>
	<li>I'm also considering adding some tag cloud functionality - just to quench my thirst for tagging.</li>
	<li>Develop a few functions; specifically an email obfuscator (most likely lift the code from wp-includes)</li>
</ul>
Who knows when I'll be able to do all this... especially when <a href="http://www.bodenko.com/">my</a> <a href="http://www.readysteadybook.com/">other</a> <a href="http://www.lee-and-lucy.com/">commitments</a> are quite demanding! ;-)

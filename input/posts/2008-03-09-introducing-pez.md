# Introducing Pez...

In between my many projects (paid and personal) and entering <a href="http://blog.leekelleher.com/2008/02/24/fatherhood/">fatherhood</a>... I seem to have found some time to start up an open-source project with <a href="http://bogdind.com/">Ben Taylor</a>, (my old comrade from the <a href="http://www.stillscreaming.com/">Scream</a> days).

<a href="http://blog.leekelleher.com/tag/pez/">I've mentioned it</a> a couple of times on my blog recently, but hadn't yet got around to introducing it... then Ben beat me to it!

<a href="http://blog.bogdind.com/2008/03/pez-lets-talk-about-it.html">So without further ado, here is Ben's introduction to Pez!</a>

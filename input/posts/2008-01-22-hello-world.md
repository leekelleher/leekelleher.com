# Hello world!

Hello and welcome to my new weblog (generously hosted here on <a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a>).

I've spent the last year (or so) trying to figure out how to best present myself online.  My last attempt was over on at <a href="http://leekelleher.com/">leekelleher.com</a>.  I had some information about myself, a linklog and details of a <a href="http://leekelleher.com/wordpress/plugins/category-cloud-widget/">WordPress plugin</a> that I developed.

I found that the linklog became redundant,  as it's easier for me to use <a href="http://del.icio.us/vertino/">del.icio.us</a> for my links/bookmarks.

The Category Cloud widget page is pretty much a mirror of the content hosted over at <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/widget-category-cloud/">WordPress.org's Plugins Directory</a>.

Apart from the tidbits of information, my personal site is somewhat lacking... and definitely overkill to maintain a WordPress installation (with regular updates, patches and security releases - it was becoming too much of a chore!)

So my latest "plan" is to have all my "user-generated content" off-site; <a href="http://del.icio.us/vertino">del.icio.us</a> (combined with <a href="http://www.digg.com/users/vertino">digg</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/08322762871648052302">Google Reader</a>) for links, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leekelleher/">Flickr</a> for photos, <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/vertino/">last.fm</a> for music-profiling and (of course) WordPress for the content (blog posts/journals/articles).

I started to look at a PHP script called <a href="http://www.creativesynthesis.net/blog/projects/personal-zeitgeist/">Personal Zeitgeist</a> to pull everything together.  It looks decent enough, so I'll see how I get on with it.

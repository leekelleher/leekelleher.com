# Social Networks are like Pubs

I received <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/factoryjoe/2265397377/">an email from Pownce</a> this morning, letting me know that they've opened the doors to all! <strong>Yah!</strong> (<em>oh, the irony</em>)

I signed up for <a href="http://pownce.com/leekelleher/">Pownce</a> a couple of months ago... configured my profile, looked for a few friends ... didn't find any ... now what?

At this point I'm reminded of <a href="http://twitter.com/robmanuel/statuses/86540552">Rob Manuel's comment about social networks</a>:
<blockquote>Social networks are pubs. There's little reason to like Facebook if your friends aren't there. Anyway, the music is too loud.</blockquote>
Obviously at the time of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Manuel">Rob</a>'s "tweet", Facebook was only just picking up speed in the UK - now it's <strong>THE</strong> place to be on-line (even for the non-geeks).  Ringing true, because all your friends are there!

Pownce is an impressive web-app, with a nice slick interface ... I'd be tempted to use it, only if I had more friends (<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=billy+no+mates">billy-no-mates</a> me!) - (<a href="http://pownce.com/leekelleher/friends/">actually I found a few now</a>)

I found another interesting article (by Chris Brogan) about the "<a href="http://chrisbrogan.com/social-networks-are-your-local-pub/">social networks are like pubs</a>" analogy.

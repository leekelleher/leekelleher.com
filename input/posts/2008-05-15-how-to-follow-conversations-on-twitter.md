# How to follow conversations on Twitter

After reading Dave's post about <a href="http://www.webdeveloper2.com/blog/2008/05/twitter-is-new-facebook.html">Twitter being the new Facebook</a> yesterday, I decided to give <a href="http://www.digsby.com/">Digsby</a> a go. (I'd heard of it previously, but I was semi-scared off by all the twittermania - it's a bit like marmite).

Since I was only following a few tweeters there wasn't of a flow - so I added a couple more higher profile tweeters, like <a href="http://twitter.com/codinghorror/">Jeff Atwood's Coding Horror</a>.

This morning Jeff tweeted:

https://twitter.com/codinghorror/statuses/811735028

I quite like <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9a1ybwek(VS.71).aspx">#region</a> in VS.NET, (it makes my code look/feel tidy).  I was curious to why Jeff had a problem with it, so I tempted to reply to his tweet.  But I stopped - thinking it was a bit of a fan-boy thing to do.  Also I'm sure someone else would have asked the same question... which got me thinking how do you follow a conversation on Twitter?

I came across <a href="http://summize.com/">Summize</a> (a search engine for Twitter) the other day, so tried that to see if anyone mentions <a href="http://summize.com/search?q=%23region">#region</a> or <a href="http://summize.com/search?q=%40codinghorror">@codinghorror</a> - which they do, but it's a tad disjointed. I couldn't follow a conversation.

So I turned to my old friend Google (<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=how+to+follow+conversations+on+twitter">how to follow conversations on twitter</a>), and found <a href="http://quotably.com/">Quotably</a>!

Now I can follow the conversation: <a href="http://quotably.com/codinghorror/statuses/811735028">http://quotably.com/codinghorror/statuses/811735028</a>

Quotably is powered by Summize, with some extra jiggery-pokery (and human intervention).

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Update (03/01/2009):</span></strong>Â Quotably has now closed it's doors. If anyone knows of a good alternative resource, please let me know in the comments.

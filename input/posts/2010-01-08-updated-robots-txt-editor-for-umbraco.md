# Updated Robots.txt Editor for Umbraco

Last night I released version 2 of the <a href="http://our.umbraco.org/projects/robotstxt-editor">Robots.txt Editor for Umbraco</a>.

Changes &amp; new features:
<ul>
	<li>Restructured the package files, they all live in a folder called "robots-txt" (still under the /umbraco folder - but self-contained)</li>
	<li>Errors are now displayed using the Feedback control (as opposed to the Speech Bubble in the bottom-right corner).</li>
	<li>Robots.txt editor has buttons for adding new User-Agent and Disallow rules, as well as comment/uncomment functionality.</li>
	<li>Changed the Robot icon... courtesy of Mozilla Firefox's "about:robots" favicon.</li>
</ul>
Hope you all enjoy the update... if you come across any bugs or ideas for a future release, <a href="http://our.umbraco.org/projects/robotstxt-editor/feedback">please let me know via the our.umbraco forum</a>.

# Google Reader

It has taken me a long time to actually get around to using RSS feeds properly - I've known about them (and developed them for other sites) for several years - but I never could get into the habit of opening a feed-reader everyday... well, the other day I thought I'd give <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/">Google's Reader</a> another go (I wasn't impressed previously) - it's only been 3 days and I'm hooked!<!--more--><br />
<br />
When I eventually get around to sharing some links on the feed, <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/08322762871648052302">you can find them here [*]</a>.

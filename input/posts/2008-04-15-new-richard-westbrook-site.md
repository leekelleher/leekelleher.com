# New Richard Westbrook Site

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.richardwestbrook.co.uk/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-24" src="http://leekelleher.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/rw-screengrab.jpg" alt="Richard Westbrook's website" width="600" height="250" /></a></p>
<a href="http://bodenko.com/">Bodenko</a> and <a href="http://www.crushdesign.co.uk/">Crush Design</a> have just launch the new website for, Porsche Supercup champion, <a href="http://www.richardwestbrook.co.uk/">Richard Westbrook</a>.

We built the site with <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> (2.5) to take advantage of it's blogging framework and also to be totally buzzword-compliant!<!--more-->

It's not often that we get to mention the sites that we've built - usually due to the non-disclosure when doing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B2B">B2B</a> projects.

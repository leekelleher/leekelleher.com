# IE View Lite 1.3.2+ not compatible with Firefox 2.0

I used all sorts of add-ons and extensions for Firefox, (I'll get around to writing a blog post on that soon too).  Since I do a lot of web-development, I switch between Firefox and Internet Explorer frequently during a build.

To make this easier, I've been using <a href="http://www.graysonmixon.com/extension/#ieview">Grayson Mixon's IE View Lite</a>. But with the latest upgrade (version 1.3.2), it broke in Firefox 2.0! (This made me sad) :-(

I'd been holding out for the next upgrade - to see if that would fix the problem... but nothing came.

So I emailed Grayson to see if there was a potential fix in a future release; which he promptly replied:
<blockquote>IE View Lite 1.3.2 and 1.3.3 are Firefox 3 only. If you want to continue using Firefox 2, you should use IE View Lite 1.3.1, the only difference being compatibility updates for Firefox 3 that broke backward compatibility.</blockquote>
I've now uninstalled version 1.3.2 - <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addons/versions/1429">reverting back to 1.3.1</a> - and everything is good again!  (Thanks Grayson).

It does concern me that support was dropped for <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=affiliates&amp;id=192858&amp;t=219">Firefox 2.0</a> in favour of version 3 (<a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-beta.html">which is still <strong>only</strong> in beta</a>) - cutting out a large proportion of the user-base.  But I guess once Firefox 3 has shipped, no one will be bothered anyway.

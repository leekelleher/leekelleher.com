# Listen to iPod through iTunes

I've just been trying to figure out why I couldn't play my iPod songs via iTunes (on my laptop). Then I found this: <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=200304040732412"><strong>Listen to iPod through iTunes</strong></a> - it's OSX-focused, but still applies to Windows iTunes.

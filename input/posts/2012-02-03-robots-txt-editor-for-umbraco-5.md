# Robots.txt Editor for Umbraco 5

First migration of my Umbraco packages to the newly released v5 (<a href="http://umbraco.codeplex.com/releases/view/81440">Jupiter</a>), I am proud to announce... <a href="http://our.umbraco.org/projects/developer-tools/robotstxt-editor">Robots.txt Editor for Umbraco 5</a>!

<a href="http://leekelleher.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/RobotsTxt-Umbraco-5.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-352" title="RobotsTxt-Umbraco-5" src="http://leekelleher.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/RobotsTxt-Umbraco-5-300x216.png" alt="" width="300" height="216" /></a>

The majority of the re-development was done during the <a href="http://our.umbraco.org/forum/core/general/28098-Umbraco-Weekend-(January-27th)">#umbWeekend</a> (last weekend - 27th January). It was fun to explore the new codebase and APIs for Umbraco v5; creating tree nodes and building the editor.  Then a few evenings this week to polish-up the UI, etc.

For any developers wanting to know more about the code/structure, please do take a look at the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/vertino/robotstxt-editor-for-umbraco">source code</a>.  Any questions, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/leekelleher">catch me on Twitter</a>.

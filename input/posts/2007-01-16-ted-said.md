# Ted Said

I've finally uploaded one of my other short films to YouTube. Ted Said was filmed about 4 years ago (wow, how times flies), and was part of the UK National 48 Hour Film Challengeâ€¦ That's right it was written, shot, edited and polished off - all within 48 hours!

... and now you can watch it online!

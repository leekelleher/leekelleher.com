# Umbraco MVP 2014 Nominee

I'm honoured to be short-listed for the Umbraco MVP 2014 awards.  I've been fortunate enough to have won the MVP award 3 times before.

In previous years, the nominations have been difficult to vote on, so many great people in the community - and this year is no exception - I had a hard time casting my votes!

To cast your votes, go to: <a href="http://our.umbraco.org/people/mvps">http://our.umbraco.org/people/mvps</a> - voting closes at midnight on 10th April 2014. The winners will be announced at <a href="http://codegarden14.com/">CodeGarden 14</a>.

Good luck to all the nominees, you all rock! <a href="http://h5yr.com">#h5yr</a>

# .NET Test-Driven Development

Has anyone got any pointers on how I should start doing test-driven development in .NET?

It's something I've been meaning to look into for years now.  I've got all the usual Visual Studio add-ons installed... NUnit, TestDriven.NET, etc.  But no idea how to use them!

Usually I learn this stuff on the job, yet from most other developers I speak to - it's all guess-work!

Any advice is much appreciated!

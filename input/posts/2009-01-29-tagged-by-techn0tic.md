# Tagged by Techn0tic

After years of dodging this tag-the-blogger ("<em>you're it!</em>") memes, it was Dave Kinsella who finally got me. So with pure fear of <a href="http://i99.photobucket.com/albums/l308/VtotheKizzle/lol/the_ring_tv.gif">a little dead girl climbing out of my TV</a> in 7 days time, I'll continue the chain.

If you are tagged you should:

(a) republish these rules
<ul>
	<li>Link to your <a href="http://webdeveloper2.com/2009/01/tagged-by-fabretti/">original tagger</a>(s) and list these rules in your post.</li>
	<li>Share seven facts about yourself in the post.</li>
	<li>Tag seven people at the end of your post by leaving their names and the links to their blogs.</li>
	<li>Let them know they’ve been tagged.</li>
</ul>
(b) share seven facts about myself
<ol>
	<li>People believe that "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053125/">North by Northwest</a>" is my favourite film, but it's actually "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118715/">The Big Lebowski</a>"</li>
	<li>Known as a Scouser, apart from being born in Liverpool, I have only lived there for 10 years, (I'm 30-years old).</li>
	<li>The remaining 20 years (so far) I have lived in the following places; Northop/North Wales, Hindley/Wigan, Westhoughton/Bolton, Columbo/Sri Lanka, Alicante/Spain and Backwell/Yatton/Bristol.</li>
	<li>Although I did a Computer Science degree, I consider myself to be a self-taught developer.</li>
	<li>Embarrassingly, I have calculated the VAT wrong 3 times on issued invoices! <em>-- how difficult can it be?</em></li>
	<li>I was in a band called <a href="http://leekelleher.com/projects/tremor/">Tremor</a>... we played at The Cavern, Matthew Street!</li>
	<li>Made a few <a href="http://leekelleher.com/projects/films/">short films</a>, which have been shown at the FACT and regularly on Canvas @ 3345 Parr St.</li>
</ol>
(c) Tag seven people. This is difficult, I don't even know 7 bloggers, but here goes:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://blog.bogdind.com/">Ben Taylor</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://teeko.tumblr.com/">Ross Jones</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.lynseyandkieran.com/">Kieran Squires</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.philprior.co.uk/mylife/">Phil Prior</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://ismail.umbraco.net/">Ismail Mayat</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://blog.prolificnotion.co.uk/">Simon Dingley</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://iamhigham.com/">Dan Higham</a></li>
</ul>

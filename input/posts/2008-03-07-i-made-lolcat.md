The photo is from my flickr photostream, [<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leekelleher/1447683047/">link</a>]; taken whilst we were staying at the farm - couldn't resist taking a snap of these two "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lovecats">love cats</a>"

Who knows why I end up doing this sort of thing... it's not like I've got time to waste these days!

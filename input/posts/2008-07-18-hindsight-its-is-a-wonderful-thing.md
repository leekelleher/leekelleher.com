# Hindsight... It's is a wonderful thing!

A couple of hours ago I received an automated email from our <a href="http://www.lee-and-lucy.com/">Travelblog</a> site, saying that we had a new user registration; which was strange, since we disabled that feature a long time ago!  Great! <strong>We've just been hacked!</strong>

I put my hands up in the air, I'd been running an old version of WordPress (<a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2007/05/wordpress-22/">2.2</a>) ... which I've been meaning to upgrade for a long time; but hey, <a href="http://www.lee-and-lucy.com/travelblog/2007/10/24/we-got-the-keys/">I've bought a house</a>, <a href="http://www.lee-and-lucy.com/travelblog/2008/02/18/katelyn-mary-kelleher/">had a baby</a> and <a href="http://bodenko.com/">build my business</a> during that time! It's not been at the top of my priories.  So yes, I'm aware of the security holes/risks, etc.

Needless to say, <a href="http://kev.coolcavemen.com/2007/06/wordpress-22-security-hole-identity-theft/">WordPress 2.2 has an ugly security hole</a> which allows hackers to remotely inject SQL statements into the database.  <em>I'd heard about this at the time, but thought I was covered because it relied on the hacker having a valid username/password (<a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4357#comment:5">see the trac ticket</a>).</em> <strong>Well it seems they don't!</strong>

Within a minute of receiving the new user registration email, I deleted the user account, changed our passwords and upgraded to <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2008/07/wordpress-26-tyner/">WordPress 2.6</a> - which came with it's own set of problems (i.e. <a href="http://blog.cumps.be/wordpress-26-upgrade-fix-missing-categories/">all the category names disappeared</a>).

Here are the details of the would-be hacker, so others know about him:

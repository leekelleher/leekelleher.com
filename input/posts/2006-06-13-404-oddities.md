# 404 Oddities

I've been noticing a lot of strange requests in theweb logs for <a href="http://www.readysteadybook.com/">ReadySteadyBook</a>, (which result in 404 errors).  Never really thought much of them, but I came across Roger Johansson's blog posting about <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200504/404_oddities/">404 oddities</a>.  So I thought I'd share some of the one's I found on <a href="http://www.readysteadybook.com/Blog.aspx">RSB</a>.

A few of them are the same as Roger found: <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%2Frobotsxx.txt"><strong>/robotsxx.txt</strong></a>; <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%2FMSOffice%2Fcltreq.asp"><strong>/MSOffice/cltreq.asp</strong></a>; <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%2F_vti_bin%2Fowssvr.dll"><strong>/_vti_bin/owssvr.dll </strong></a>

<!--more-->But some of the others seem more like hacker attempts:

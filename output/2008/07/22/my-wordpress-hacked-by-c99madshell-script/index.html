			<p>After all the excitement of last Friday’s attempted hack on my <a href="http://www.lee-and-lucy.com/">travelblog</a>, and the subsequent upgrade to <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2008/07/wordpress-26-tyner/">WordPress 2.6</a> – I thought everything was under control.&nbsp; <em><strong>Boy was I wrong!</strong></em></p>
<p>A few hours ago I received a blog comment (from a Mr Andrew Wong) on the <a href="http://www.lee-and-lucy.com/travelblog/2008/07/19/attempted-hack/">travelblog</a>:</p>

<p>I clicked the link, my jaw dropped!&nbsp; It wasn’t an attempted hack, it was a very successful hack… I felt violated -in a digital sense.&nbsp; The threat was far from over!</p>
<p>From looking through the WordPress management screens, I couldn’t find a blog post with the ID #5817.&nbsp; I opened up phpMyAdmin to see if it was in the database; nope, nada, nothing!</p>
<p>I wanted to see the extend of the problem, so I googled “<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=site:lee-and-lucy.com">site:lee-and-lucy.com</a>“, and found a “lot” of pages… oh yes, LOTS OF SPAM!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=site:lee-and-lucy.com"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76" src="http://leekelleher.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/clipboard01.png" alt="" width="551" height="300"></a></p>
<p>To say the least, <a href="http://twitter.com/leekelleher/statuses/864498898">I was furious</a>!&nbsp; I wanted to; <em>a.</em> resolve this asap; <em>b.</em> find out how this happened; <em>c.</em> cause pain to this would-be hacker!&nbsp; Obviously, option <em>c.</em> goes against my good karma nature, but they digitally violated my site; sticking spam in places that spam should never go!!! <em><strong>Furious I tell you!</strong></em></p>
<p>Digging through my WordPress files, I find a PHP script in my theme folder called “<code>simple.php</code>“; it contains a nested “<code>eval(gzinflate(base64_encode()))</code>” string.&nbsp; Very suspect. I try to manually decrypt the string, (replacing the eval with an echo), but it’s nested a few levels deep… so <a href="http://uk3.php.net/manual/en/function.eval.php#59862">I found a snippet of code that would easily decode/decrypt it</a>.</p>
<p>The script turned out to be a modified version of <a href="http://www.derekfountain.org/security_c99madshell.php">c99madshell</a>, specifically focused on <a href="http://wordpress.org/tags/c99madshell">WordPress hi-jacks</a>.&nbsp; The script tries to inject a small trojan code into one of the core WP files (for me it was the “<code>wp-blog-header.php</code>“).&nbsp; I removed the hi-jacked code, along with the “<code>simple.php</code>” file (from my theme folder) – then re-upgraded to the latest WordPress (2.6) … just to overwrite any other tampered files.</p>
<p>Hopefully this should be the end of this matter (until next time) ….&nbsp; I’ll be keeping a careful eye on my WordPress installations now on.</p>

<p>The Robots Exclusion Protocol has been around for many years, yet there are a lot of web-developers who are unaware of the reasons for having a robots.txt file in the root of their websites.</p>
<p>There have been many rumours around whether the bigger search engine crwalers (i.e. Googlebot) consider your website amateurish if you didn’t have a robots.txt – and if handled badly, could lead to your site being invisible on SERPs.</p>
<p>If you are happy for a crawler to crawl/index all of your website’s content, then you can use the following:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">User-agent: *
Disallow:</pre>
<p>However, when using Umbraco to power my websites, it is preferable to define which folders are accessible by the crawler. Personally, I would not like to see the contents of my <code>/umbraco/</code> folder to be returned in Google’s SERPs.</p>
<p>Here is an example of the robots.txt that I have used on several Umbraco-powered websites.</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title=""># robots.txt for Umbraco
User-agent: *
Disallow: /aspnet_client/
Disallow: /bin/
Disallow: /config/
Disallow: /css/
Disallow: /data/
Disallow: /scripts/
Disallow: /umbraco/
Disallow: /umbraco_client/
Disallow: /usercontrols/
Disallow: /xslt/</pre>
<p>From my perspective, there is no reason for a search engine crawler to be crawling/indexing files from any of the above folders – you may have a different perspective, to which you can amend your robots.txt accordingly.</p>
<p>For more information about the robots.txt standard, please refer to the official website: <a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html">http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html</a></p>

			<p>A question was asked on the Our Umbraco forum about how to downgrade a version of uComponents (<a href="http://our.umbraco.org/projects/backoffice-extensions/ucomponents/questionssuggestions/44702-uninstalling-when-2-versions-installed">from v5.4.0 to v4.1.0 – as they were using Umbraco v4.7.2</a>).</p>
<p>There may well be other reasons that you would want to downgrade uComponents to a previous version – whether that be for Umbraco compatibility or maybe even you don’t use the package any more and just want to uninstall it.</p>
<p>Firstly, <strong>DO NOT</strong> uninstall the package from within the back-office, as that will start to remove any data-types you have created (that use a uComponents editor/control), which subsequently will remove any content that used those data-types. So unless you want that to happen, don’t “uninstall the package”!</p>
<p>Here are the steps that you should take to downgrade from v5.x to v4.x (this can also apply to earlier version too):</p>
<ol>
<li>Make a back-up of your “/bin” folder (specifically all the “uComponents.*.dll” files) – just in case it all goes wrong</li>
<li>Delete all the “uComponents.*.dll”s <strong>EXCEPT</strong> for “uComponents.Core.dll” file.</li>
<li>Within the back-office, reinstall uComponents v4.x</li>
<li>Ta-dah! All is good in the world again</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, there is one outstanding problem, that is the back-office will still list multiple versions of uComponents as installed. However that is just for display purposes; in reality you will only have v4.x installed. To fix this, you will have to manually edit the “/App_Data/packages/installed/installedPackages.config” XML file and remove the entry for “uComponents 5.x”. Save the file, check the back-office and the only the correctly installed version (v4.x) should appear.</p>

			<p>At our recent <a href="http://www.meetup.com/umBristol/events/230457961/">umBristol meetup earlier this month</a>, I announced that there wouldn't be another meet-up until after the summer, <em>as I'll be away on extended holiday; plus, there's <a href="http://codecab.in">CodeCabin</a> in early September</em>. I proposed to the group that if they wanted to organise an umBristol whilst I was away, then I can give them organiser access rights on the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/umBristol/">Meetup.com group</a>.</p>
<p>Now, <em>between you and me</em>, I'm hoping that someone steps up to the mark on this.  Along with <a href="https://twitter.com/iomisolutions">Dan Bramall</a>, we've been running umBristol for the past 6 years, with over 50 meetups organised, - <em>okay, every other month is a pub social</em>, but still there's been a certain pressure and demand on us.</p>
<p>For me, the hardest part about organising an Umbraco user-group has been trying to find people to present on a specific topic. Typically, most umBristol folk are .NET developers, so in-depth technical talks aren't too much of an issue. Yet with more abstract CMS topics, such as content modelling or editorial workflow, I felt that we've been somewhat lacking.</p>
<p>Truth be told, over the past few years I've become tired with the "lecture" format. It's increasingly difficult for me to sit still and listen for a set period of time.  I find it much more engaging to have a starting topic, and let others get involved with a discussion.  I enjoy learning from a collective experience.</p>
<p>All things have a life cycle, I guess I've reached that time to take a break and let someone else take the <a href="http://umbristol.co.uk/">umBristol</a> reins for a while.</p>
<p>With all that said, I've met a lot of great people at the meet-ups, many who are now close friends. I'd like to say <strong>a huge <a href="http://h5yr.com">#h5yr</a> to all the companies that have hosted our meetups</strong> and <strong>much love to the umBristol massive, long may it continue!</strong></p>

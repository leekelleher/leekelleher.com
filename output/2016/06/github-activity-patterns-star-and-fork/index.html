			<p>Confession time, I check my GitHub activity feed dashboard as much as I check my Twitter timeline. I know a lot of people who ignore their GitHub dashboard, but for me I find it a great source of information... to see who is working on what; if there are any new Umbraco related open-source projects; and also if anyone has starred or forked one of my projects.</p>
<p>Over the past few years I've noticed patterns emerge on the activity feed, sometimes there'll be a tweet about a new Umbraco package and I'll see a spate of people starring the project's repository, but then other times there are patterns that I can't explain, here's an example.</p>
<p>Scanning down my activity feed, I notice <code>someone</code> has forked one of my projects...</p>
<p><img src="/assets/media/github-activity-pattern-1.png" alt="Screengrab of a GitHub activity pattern - forking a project"></p>
<p>"<strong><em>Excellent</em></strong>" I think, <code>someone</code> might be preparing a pull request... <em>Yes, a contribution! (Excited!)</em></p>
<p>Then I see the next line...</p>
<p><img src="/assets/media/github-activity-pattern-2.png" alt="Screengrab of GitHub activity pattern - forking and starring a project"></p>
<p>The same <code>someone</code> has starred the project. I let out a sigh and resign myself that there will be no contribution.</p>
<p>I can't say that I understand this pattern of "<strong>Star &amp; Fork</strong>", but it has become quite common. Each time I see it, I've never had a subsequent contribution on that project.</p>
<p>Maybe <code>someone</code> is starring the project as a bookmark, then forking it to keep a copy of the code for themselves?  Either way it's an interesting pattern.</p>
<p>If you have any ideas on this, or have noticed other curious GitHub activity patterns, let me know in the comments.</p>

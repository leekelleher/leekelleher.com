			<h2>TL;DR;</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Is this site broken?</strong></p>
<p>No. I decided to try an experiment with letting my website go CSS naked. It's an attempt for me to make proper use of Web Standards, HTML5, semantic markup and hierarchical structure.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>My reasoning</h2>
<p>When I decided to reboot my website, I started to spend time browsing themes and designs, while I found many decent ones, there wasn't any that I felt comfortable with. I didn't have much interest in designing my own - using the latest CSS framework, with a dozen dependencies. I was getting bogged down with the style/presentation.</p>
<p>I wanted to bring my focus back to content; <em>I wanted full control of my website!</em></p>
<p>I decided to leave the CSS out of it, forget about JavaScript and web-fonts, let's focus on using HTML, pure and simple, structural and semantic.  The added bonus is that my website would be accessible, responsive, lightweight and fast!</p>
<p>Will this look pretty? No! Default browser styles suck - at least that's what we're told. Although I'm sure that people who visit my website aren't looking for a good design, they should want the content, so now I can present it in the most accessible way.</p>
<h3>What will the future hold?</h3>
<p>In time I may introduce some styling, tweak the viewport width or apply a reasonable typography, but for now I'd like to focus on the semantics of the markup - to lay a solid foundation to build on.</p>
<p>As for JavaScript, previously I would automatically add in Google Analytics, but truth be told, I hardly study my traffic or data these days. It doesn't motivate me.</p>
<p>I'm likely to reintroduce the Disqus commenting system very soon.</p>

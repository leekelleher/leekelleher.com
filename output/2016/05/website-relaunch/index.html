			<p>Wow, I finally pressed the button and my rebuilt website has been launched. I have to admit, I was quite nervous about making the actual switch from WordPress to a static HTML site. I kept thinking "<em>What have I missed?</em>", but throw caution to the wind, it's my own website - if anything breaks, <strong>I'll just fix it</strong>.</p>
<p>It feels like I've wanted to move away from having a dynamically-generated website for the longest time. I'd been looking at various tools to help me "go static" - from Assemble to Jekyll, most of the static-site generators have their pros &amp; cons, my main concern was my comfort zone.  Just to say, I have built websites using Assemble and Jekyll, but in those cases, I found myself struggling from an extensibility perspective - if I needed my own plug-ins, I'd need to develop with Ruby or Node.js - I mean, I could, but it's out my comfort-zone.</p>
<p>About a year ago, I heard about a new static-site generator called <a href="http://wyam.io">Wyam</a>, it was open-source and written in .NET, and looked well documented! I couldn't wait to play! Unfortunately, between my work and Umbraco-community commitments, I struggled to make the time for it.  That was until at the start of this year, I told myself to stop making excuses and get on with it!</p>
<p>So I started to rebuild my website with <a href="http://wyam.io">Wyam</a>. After an initial learning curve of the key concepts, I was flying - I even started to contribute modules back to the Wyam core, (the <a href="http://wyam.io/modules/minifyhtml">minifications modules</a> - if anyone is interested?) I had most of my website/blog rebuilt within a day or so. (Deciding to go "<a href="/2016/03/back-to-basics/">Back to basics</a>" helped speed things along much faster.)</p>
<p>Now I bet you're wondering what took me so long between starting and relaunching my website? It turns out to be all those little things - reformatting of line code snippets, redirection rules (<code>.htaccess</code>), Disqus commenting, contact form, etc.  To be honest, I probably could have relaunched a few weeks ago, but I'd re-prioritised working on one of my Umbraco packages (<a href="https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-ditto/releases/tag/0.9.0-beta">Ditto v0.9.0-beta</a> - again, if anyone is interested?).</p>
<p>So here we are... website relaunched - CSS naked, but HTML semantically enriched.  Let me know what you think in the comments.</p>

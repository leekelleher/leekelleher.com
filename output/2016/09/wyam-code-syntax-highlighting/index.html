			<p>I'd been going back and forth on how I should handle the syntax highlighting of my blog's code snippets. A popular choice would be to use a JavaScript library, (such as <a href="https://github.com/google/code-prettify">Prettify</a> or <a href="http://prismjs.com/">Prism</a>). I have nothing against those libraries, but in the pursuit of making my website fast and lightweight, I wanted a non-JavaScript option.  My idea was to use a .NET library to convert my source-code snippets into colourised markup.</p>
<p>The only library that I knew of (in .NET land) was <a href="https://colorcode.codeplex.com/">ColorCode</a>. CodePlex use for their source-code highlighting, <em>so it should be stable</em>, but it hasn't been updated in a few years, <em>so fingers crossed!</em></p>
<p>My next step was to figure out how to make this happen in <a href="http://wyam.io">Wyam</a>.  Now, Wyam is a very versatile generator, there are many ways this problem could be tackled... it should be a simple search &amp; replace, right? Alas, after a couple of hours hacking around, I wasn't getting anywhere, <em>I was stumpted!</em></p>
<p>Heading over to the <a href="https://gitter.im/Wyamio/Wyam">Wyam chat room on Gitter</a>, I wanted to see if anyone had any ideas for this. There was a suggestion of treating my code snippets as assets, cross-referencing and pulling them in at build-time. But that would require making structural changes to my blog, which I'd rather not at this juncture.</p>
<p>Then <a href="http://daveaglick.com/">Dave Glick</a> had an idea... <em>he claims to have been <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">Nerd Snippered</a></em> ... and he was away, updating code, released a new version of Wyam, and wrote a blog post. <em>I was presented with a solution!</em> <em>Thanks again Dave!</em></p>

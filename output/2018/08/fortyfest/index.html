			<p>At last year's <a href="https://codecab.in/">CodeCabin, (our Umbraco community developer retreat)</a>, I was chatting with Lucy Brailsford and Lotte Pitcher about having just moved house, and I had access to a jointly-owned field at the back of the house. Very quickly the suggestion of having a "festival" in the field came up, and along with my unavoidable 40th birthday, someone muttered the words... <strong>FortyFest™</strong>.<br>
<em>(I can't recall if it was Lucy or Lotte, but anyway, an idea was born.)</em></p>

<p>I didn't really think much more about it until after Christmas. Although 6 months felt like a long time away, I knew I wanted a giant tipi as the centerpiece of the festival, so I contacted Luke (of <a href="http://tipievents.co.uk/">Tipi Events</a>) to come do a recce of my field and book it in. Then it was case of aligning the other big tasks... food, drinks, live bands.</p>
<p>Luckily, it turns out that we had some great contacts to call on, within a month or so, the hot food was scheduled in; live music sorted, courtesy of my talented friends from our local open-mic night - including my own band... <em>and a few special guests!</em></p>
<p>It wasn't all plain sailing, FortyFest was drawing closer, we hit a showstopper - it's a long story - but the gist is that we were unable to secure vehicle access to our field. Which meant we couldn't get the tipi or portaloos into the field. <em>(There's more to it, but like I say, it's a long story.)</em></p>
<p>Fortunately, Lucy's brother-in-law, Steve, came to the rescue by offering to host FortyFest in one of his fields, (at the dairy farm where I lived for a while, over 10 years ago).  The only downside being the farm was a few miles away, so people would need to figure out transport or camping.  The upside, the farm field was massive, a much better venue.</p>
<p>In the week running up to FortyFest, everything started to come together. I kept thinking, <em>something has to go wrong - if that one thing goes wrong, then everything else will be okay</em>.  Then I saw the weather forecast... rain and heavy winds, urgh!</p>
<p>Despite the weather, FortyFest turned out to be a pretty damn awesome 40th birthday party.</p>

<p>In hindsight, I may have overcomitted myself in the music department. I was part of two bands, one 30 minute set with Paul Hagan, <em>(my old Tremor bandmate)</em>, in our newly formed band / never rehearsed <strong>The Kecks</strong>; and then an hour set with my covers band <strong>The Dysfunctions</strong>!</p>
<p>Thank you everyone involved in making FortyFest happen! It was a great night!</p>
<p>Roll on <strong>Forty-First-Fest™</strong> ;-)</p>

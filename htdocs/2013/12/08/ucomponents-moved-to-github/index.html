			<p>Hey uComponents fans, a little status update on our version control repository move from CodePlex over to GitHub. We’d been talking about moving over to GitHub for a long time, (even before Umbraco core moved over), but the timing was never right – either we were in the middle of a major release or our day-job workloads were in high demand. &nbsp;Luckily since our own v6.0.0 release, we have found the time to make the move!</p>
<p>The new repository is currently hosted on my personal account –&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/leekelleher/uComponents">https://github.com/leekelleher/uComponents</a> – but once this has been stabilised, I will relocated it the main <a href="https://github.com/uComponents">uComponents organisation</a> account.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Update:</span> The repository has now been moved to the organisation account:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/uComponents/uComponents">https://github.com/uComponents/uComponents</a></strong></p>
<p>For those who are interested in how I migrated from our Mercurial (Hg) repository on CodePlex over to Git; we used <a href="http://hg-git.github.io/">the&nbsp;Hg-Git mercurial plugin</a> to handle the main bulk of the conversion. The initial set-up had some tricky parts, mostly around installing a specific version of Python (v2.6.6) and the&nbsp;Dulwich library (v0.8.0+). But once configured, it all works very well.</p>
<p>The biggest issue I had was trying to map the commit authors with their corresponding GitHub accounts. There are various blog posts on how to generate an “<a href="https://github.com/schacon/hg-git#gitauthors">AUTHORS.TXT</a>” file that will map users/emails, but I ended up using the following Hg command to get a list of the authors from all the commits/changesets.</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">hg log --template "{author} = {author} rn" &gt; AUTHORS.TXT</pre>
<p>The output from this gave me a huge list of usernames/email addresses. &nbsp;I used a feature in Notepad++’s TextFX Tools to sort and de-duplicate the lines. &nbsp;From there I found the corresponding GitHub email addresses (this wasn’t pretty either – you’re on your own here). &nbsp;Then I wired up hg-git’s <a href="https://github.com/schacon/hg-git#gitauthors"><strong>git.author</strong></a> option to use the AUTHORS.TXT for the mapping.</p>
<p>The rest of the move to GitHub has gone successfully. &nbsp;We still need to agree on a better branching structure/workflow, as the one we’ve been using for the past few years has worked well, we feel that it is off-putting to newcomers. &nbsp;We are currently looking at using <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">git-flow</a>, but are still open to any other suggestions.</p>

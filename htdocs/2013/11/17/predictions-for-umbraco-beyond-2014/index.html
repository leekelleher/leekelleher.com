			<p>With <a href="http://our.umbraco.org/contribute/releases/700">Umbraco 7</a> release imminent, the community will be eager to see its adoption. For those who have been following the progress of its development, the entire back-office has been re-built from the ground up – from UX concepts to the introduction of the <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS framework</a>. &nbsp;(For technical details, see <a href="http://umbraco.github.io/Belle/">the Belle documentation website</a>.)</p>
<p>The introduction of AngularJS is a major shift for Umbraco – it is also a bold statement – that <em>web-technology is moving forwards and we are embracing it!</em></p>
<p>The consequence is that any 3rd-party back-office add-ons using WebForm-based DataTypes (or Macro Params)<a href="http://leekelleher.com/2013/11/17/predictions-for-umbraco-beyond-2014/#comment-1127790087">*</a> would no longer be supported.&nbsp;The impact of this on future adoption is be unknown, we’ll wait and see how package developers deal with refactoring/upgrading their Property Editor codebases.</p>
<p>This isn’t all doom and gloom, personally I have high hopes for Umbraco 7 – my point is that technology progresses, despite the backlash; despite the risks involved.</p>
<p>Seeing the use of AngularJS in the Umbraco back-office, I started to think how else could Umbraco progress, beyond the boundaries of the .NET framework/MS-stack. &nbsp;Here are my predictions for Umbraco, not for the immediate future, but say a 5-year future.</p>
<h3>node.js</h3>
<p>With the introduction of AngularJS in the back-office, all of the “server-side” is handled by ASP.NET Web API. &nbsp;This means that the CMS&nbsp;business-logic has been abstracted way from the back-office UI. Which leads to the question, could it be replaced? &nbsp;Enter <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>. Node.js is a platform built on top of Chrome’s JavaScript runtime – meaning that it is a very fast, scalable and robust architecture. &nbsp;The main advantage of using node.js for Umbraco’s business-logic would opening it up to cross-platform (OS) support. Along with exposure to a vast number of JavaScript application developers.</p>
<p>Just think, running the same code on the server and the client? There are a lot of geek-romantic ideas of&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.nodejitsu.com/scaling-isomorphic-javascript-code">isomorphic JavaScript</a> <a href="http://nerds.airbnb.com/isomorphic-javascript-future-web-apps/">floating about</a>.</p>
<p>(You’ll see from the <a href="http://umbraco.github.io/Belle/">Belle documentation website</a>, node.js can already be used for mocking the data-layer.)</p>
<h3>NoSQL (document database)</h3>
<p>Following the idea of Umbraco being cross-platform, the database component is a dilemma. SQL Server has served us very well, it is a great relational-database – of course, it is the de facto choice on the MS-stack.</p>
<p>If we take a step back and look at the nature of Umbraco, how flexible the schemas for content &amp; media are defined – this could be represented in a document database.</p>
<p>I don’t have any predictions of which NoSQL/document-database could be used, (there are so many! mongodb, redis, RavenDB – to name a few); but it’s a topic worth exploring.</p>
<h3>The&nbsp;bifurcation of Umbraco</h3>
<p>There’s a great post on&nbsp;Gadgetopia called&nbsp;<a href="http://gadgetopia.com/post/7208">The Bifurcation of Content Management and Delivery</a>, which discusses the concept of separating the content-management (WCMS) from the content-delivery (WCDS). &nbsp;In terms of Umbraco, I think we’ll see a demand for separating the “front-end” from the “back-office”. There’ll be teams who will love the editorial experience that Umbraco offers, but are not willing to be forced to use the front-end technology/framework. &nbsp;One potential solution would be for the default Umbraco to ship with its own detachable front-end “runtime” – becoming even more of a Lego analogy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finishing up with a little note… these are all my own personal predictions, they don’t represent my company, (<a href="http://www.umbrellainc.co.uk/">Umbrella</a>), nor do I have any “insider knowledge” from the Umbraco core team or HQ. They are just things that I’d been thinking about and wanted to get them “out there”. &nbsp;Let’s discuss, collaborate and most of all progress! :-)</p>

			<p>At last month's <a href="http://codecab.in">Code Cabin</a>, I was chatting with <a href="https://twitter.com/Steve_Gibe">Steve Temple</a> about <a href="https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-ditto">Ditto</a> and best coding practices, he suggested that I read <a href="http://amzn.to/2cNuLHF">Elegant Objects by Yegor Bugayenko</a>, as it made him think totally differently about object-oriented programming.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/media/elegant-objects.jpg" alt="Lee with Elegant Objects book"></p>
<p>Looking around <a href="http://www.yegor256.com/">Yegor's blog</a>, I liked his ideas, so I ordered the book ... I even noticed a small CSS bug on his blog and <a href="https://github.com/yegor256/blog/pull/133">submitted a fix</a> for it. <strong>I do love open-source!</strong></p>
<p>A day or so later the book arrived and I couldn't put it down. The blurb on the cover says it all...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TL;DR There are 23 practical recommendations for object-oriented programmers. Most of them are completely against everything you've read in other books. For example, static methods, NULL references, getters, setters, and mutable classes are called evil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I started coding with BASIC (on a Spectrum 48K) as a kid, then "professionally" as a web-developer since 2000 doing Classic ASP/VBScript. The vast majority of my coding comes from a procedural background, I knew I had bad habits when doing OOP, but <em>oh boy</em>, whilst reading the book I had no idea how much I was "doing it wrong".</p>
<p>The book has many principles that I agreed with in theory, but I wasn't sure how I would practically apply them. The majority of the development I do is with C#/.NET and Umbraco CMS implementations, where most of the anti-patterns (as outlined in the book - such as returning <code>null</code> object values) are a common occurrence.</p>
<p>Given the insight into how to develop clean, maintainable object-oriented code, I feel that I can at least improve on my own application and library code.</p>
<p>If you are an open-minded developer, who is looking for new and thought provoking ideas, I would definitely recommend this book.</p>

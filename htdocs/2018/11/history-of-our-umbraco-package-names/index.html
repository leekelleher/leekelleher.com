			<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://twitter.com/callumbwhyte/status/820641163334053889">Callum asked the question</a>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can someone explain the history behind the "Our.Umbraco.X" naming convention for packages? It seems it's used by only a few now #umbraco</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/leekelleher/status/820727834536767488">replied at the time</a> - but felt an explanation longer than a couple of tweets would be nice, (and findable for future reference). I had a draft of this post sitting around for a while now, thought best to publish it!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/rikhelsen/6269167834/in/album-72157627950157764/" title="Umbraco community hacking"><img src="/assets/media/umb-collab.jpg" alt="IMG_4590"></a></p>
<p>When I started to work with Umbraco, back in late 2007, my company was called <strong>Bodenko</strong>. When we developed any back-office features, they all ended up being bundled into a single project called <strong>"Bodenko.Umbraco"</strong> - this quickly became a dumping ground for all our extensions.</p>
<p>After getting more involved with the community, asking a lot of questions on the forum - and starting to answer some of them, I thought that I should really open-source the packages we'd developed at Bodenko. Our first was the <a href="https://our.umbraco.com/packages/developer-tools/robotstxt-editor/"><strong>Robots.txt Editor</strong></a> (which is surprisingly still popular today - and with very little updates to the original codebase) … I named the assembly <strong>"Bodenko.Umbraco.RobotsTxtEditor"</strong>.</p>
<p>In 2009, I'd parted ways with Bodenko to go as a solo freelancer, we dissolved the company. Around this time, I'd attended my first CodeGarden - where they'd launched the new forum… <strong>Our Umbraco</strong> - it was a very exciting time within the community. The Robots.txt Editor project was due a patch release (roll up of bug fixes), but when I reviewed the code, I felt that my old company name held little relevance to the package itself. There wasn't much point in using the package to "advertise" our old company and services. So, I looked to change it.</p>
<p>My company name for my freelance work was called <strong>Vertino</strong>, I could have swapped it with that, but that didn't feel quite right either. Around the same time, I'd noticed there were a few other newly released packages that contained a name/reference to the company that developed them, and it somewhat felt a little <em>anti-community</em>.</p>
<p>Rather than trying to come up with a new base part for my code's namespaces, I did a swap of <strong>"Bodenko"</strong> with <strong>"Our"</strong>. I still can't decide if that was a clever idea or I was being lazy - <em>probably the latter</em>.</p>
<p>I never envisaged this as trying to start a convention, then as I got involved with other established Umbraco packages, e.g. <a href="https://our.umbraco.com/packages/developer-tools/config-tree/">Config Tree</a> and <a href="https://our.umbraco.com/packages/backoffice-extensions/google-maps-datatype/">Google Maps DataType</a>, with the agreement of their developers, we renamed the namespaces and assemblies over time.</p>
<p>Ironically, we never changed the <a href="https://our.umbraco.com/packages/backoffice-extensions/ucomponents/">uComponents</a> namespace or assemblies - considering that at the time, that project was considered to be the <em>de facto</em> Umbraco community project.</p>
<p>The idea was that these packages were <strong>made by the Umbraco community, for the Umbraco community</strong>.</p>
<p>I didn't push this naming convention, but interestingly I noticed other package developers had started to use it. It had become an unspoken guideline.</p>
<p>More recently, the packages that I've collaborated on with <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbrailsford">Matt Brailsford</a> have generally come from working together at my company <strong>Umbrella</strong> (where Matt has freelanced with us). However, when we started coding and setting up namespaces, if we used <strong>"Umbrella.Umbraco.*"</strong> it wouldn't feel quite right. We knew from the outset that certain back-office extensions had the potential to be released as fully-fledged Umbraco packages - we always start out with that mindset… <strong>"for the community"</strong>.</p>
<p>So, if you ever look in your website's <code>/bin</code> folder and see a bunch of "Our.Umbraco.*" assemblies, then you now know they were developed with the community in mind and are a sign of thoughtful, well-crafted Umbraco packages.</p>

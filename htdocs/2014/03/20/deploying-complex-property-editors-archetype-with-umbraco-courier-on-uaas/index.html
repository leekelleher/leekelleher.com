<p>We’re very fortunate that with our latest project at <a href="http://www.umbrellainc.co.uk/">Umbrella</a> we are getting to develop with cutting-edge Umbraco technologies: <a href="http://our.umbraco.org/download">Umbraco v7</a>, <a href="https://www.umbraco.io">Umbraco as a Service</a> (UaaS) and the <a href="http://imulus.github.io/Archetype/">Archetype property-editor</a>.</p>
<p>If you haven’t yet heard about UaaS yet, then be sure to catch-up with the recent&nbsp;<a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/cqfvk55ami6fio1norg3apjgs58">uHangout episode where Niels Hartvig explains all</a>.</p>
<p>Initially starting development with v7 was quite daunting, as with my past experience of v4/v6 I had a wealth of data-types and packages at my disposal; the most vital one being <a href="http://ucomponents.org">uComponents</a>! What would I do without the Multi-UrlPicker?! <em>Enter Archetype!</em></p>
<p>In a nutshell,&nbsp;<a href="http://our.umbraco.org/projects/backoffice-extensions/archetype">Archetype</a> is a new v7 property-editor that wraps around other data-types. This can either be as a single fieldset or grouped into multiple fieldsets. If you’re familiar with <a href="http://ucomponents.org/data-types/datatype-grid/">DataType Grid</a>, or Embedded Content – it’s like those, but made with tiger blood! &nbsp;Check out&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7l-QKSDZgM">Kevin Giszewski’s video demo showcasing Archetype’s features</a>.<a dir="ltr" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/gizmogeekstv" data-sessionlink="feature=watch&amp;ei=XFgrU-P-MMjI0QXoo4DQAw" data-ytid="UChlB-wD_eeXZkDkCUjcn1pw" data-name="watch"><br> </a></p>
<p>Here’s an example of how we’re using Archetype as a pseudo Multi-UrlPicker on our Umbraco website:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://leekelleher.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/archetype-multi-urlpicker.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1327" src="http://leekelleher.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/archetype-multi-urlpicker.png" alt="archetype-multi-urlpicker" width="100%" srcset="http://leekelleher.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/archetype-multi-urlpicker-300x105.png 300w, http://leekelleher.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/archetype-multi-urlpicker-1024x360.png 1024w, http://leekelleher.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/archetype-multi-urlpicker.png 1199w" sizes="(max-width: 1199px) 100vw, 1199px"></a>
</p>
<p>We found this works well and our content editors are happy with the interface.</p>
<p>All was well and good in our local development environment, then when we pushed our content changes up to our UaaS environment — we hit major issues with the node Id values inside our Archetype’s nested Content Pickers!</p>
<p>For those of you who have done team-development and multi-environment deployments with Umbraco may have experienced a similar situation; this usually leads to a lot of swearing and tearing out hair!</p>
<p><em>“Now! Have no fear. Have no fear!” said the cat.”</em>&nbsp; There is a solution and it’s name <strong>Courier</strong>!</p>
<p>At this point, I have to admit that my past experience with Courier had been pretty hit &amp; miss — sometimes it worked, sometimes it failed. Looking back I think maybe I’d expected too much from it.</p>
<p>Since Courier is one of the underpinning features of UaaS, I thought it wise to wipe the slate clean, let’s put the past behind us!</p>
<p>I read up about <a href="https://github.com/umbraco/Courier/blob/master/Documentation/Developer%20Documentation/Data%20Resolvers.md">Courier’s DataResolvers</a> and&nbsp;how to develop one for your own property-editor — from packing up a data-type’s prevalue options to extracting a content node’s property value.</p>
<p>The key point to remember, is that whenever you have a custom property-editor that can store a node Id (of any type – Content, Media, etc), you should consider developing a Courier DataResolver for it. &nbsp;<em>I wish that someone had told me this during our main uComponents development!</em></p>
<p>Due to the complex nature of Archetype, the DataResolver needed to handle both the prevalue options and the node’s property values. &nbsp;The prevalue options were easy to resolve, as I knew these only referenced other data-type Ids. &nbsp;The node’s property values were much more trickier, as these could&nbsp;potentially&nbsp;reference <strong><em><strong>any</strong></em>** node type (e.g. Content, Media, etc) and use **<em><strong>any</strong></em></strong>&nbsp;type of data structure (e.g. JSON, XML, etc).</p>
<p>I had to think of a smart solution.</p>
<p>OK, so here’s the part where I moan about Courier being closed-source and not being able to dig into the API&nbsp;<em>… yadda, yadda, yadda …</em>&nbsp;ultimately I said hello to my old friend .NET Reflector and cracked open the assemblies. (<em>I probably broke a license agreement in doing this – apologies! My motive was knowledge, not profit.</em>)</p>
<p>From the assemblies I investigated how the&nbsp;<code>ResolutionManager</code> worked – this was key as I wanted to use it to pass the inner/nested values from an Archetype to it – meaning that Courier itself would attempt to resolve any node Ids! &nbsp;<em>Happy days!</em> &nbsp; (This even applied to any Archetypes that were nested within an Archetype … <em>think about that for a minute.</em>)</p>

<p>If you are interested in seeing <a href="https://github.com/imulus/Archetype/blob/master/app/Umbraco/Archetype.Courier/DataResolvers/ArchetypeDataResolver.cs">the full source-code for the Archetype DataResolver, it is available on my GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<p>For other <a href="https://github.com/umbraco/Courier/tree/master/Providers/Umbraco.Courier.DataResolvers">examples of DataResolvers, there are examples on Umbraco’s Courier repository</a>&nbsp;– yup, it’s not all closed-source! ;-)</p>

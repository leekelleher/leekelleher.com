<p>Last week's rubbish cold &amp; cough lingered around for most of the week, not as bad as the previous week, mostly an annoying cough. Which everyone kept asking me if it was COVID-19, <em>it wasn't</em>.</p>

<p>I totally forgot to post my <b>Alphabet Albums</b> update, <em>(I blame the cold, again)</em>, anyway we're up to "L"... <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1j2rtIlRBcUHmxtn4Z4vGc">Ladytron - Witching Hour</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6aSk2vxoY3xtz7cXKuY9EL">LCD Soundsystem - LCD Soundsystem</a>, and <a href="https://www.allmusic.com/album/looking-for-a-day-in-the-night-mw0000246042">The Lilac Time - Looking For A Day In The Night</a> <em>(which isn't on any streaming media, so time to dust off the CD player!)</em></a></p>

<p>Tuesday, I <a href="https://ecologi.com/umbraco?treeId=60bf6120ff5e2a9e6bdcd453">planted a 50 trees</a> in <a href="">Umbraco's Ecologi forest</a>. I say I planted them, donated towards <a href="https://ecologi.com/projects/mangrove-planting-in-madagascar">planting a mangrove in Madagascar</a>. ðŸŒ³</p>

<p>Wednesday, Thursday and Friday was <a href="https://codegarden.umbraco.com/"><strong>Umbraco CodeGarden 2021!</strong></a></p>

<p>For <a href="https://umbracosecretsanta.com/">Umbraco Community Secret Santa</a> last year, I was gifted a lovely custom jigsaw of <a href="https://github.com/lars-erik/codegarden-2020-group-image">the CodeGarden 2020 group photo</a>. <em>(Of course, CG20 didn't happen, due to COVID, but we were all missing each other, so a fake/virtual/mash-up group photo was the only solution!)</em> I'd been waiting to do the jigsaw in the run up to CG21, so I did it on Wednesday. I'd given myself several hours to complete it, turns out that I did it in just over 2 hours.</p>

<p>Wednesday evening was the CG21 pre-party show, <a href="https://twitter.com/lottepitcher">Lotte</a> was hosting and invited me, <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbrailsford">Matt</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/KevinJump">Kevin</a> on for a chat about Umbraco stuff. I dusted off my Tux for the show, bit daft really. ðŸ¤£</p>

<p>Thursday morning was the MVP award announcement, <a href="https://umbraco.com/blog/the-umbraco-2021-mvps/#:~:text=Lee%20Kelleher">I've been renewed again...</a> for the <strong>11th time!</strong> ðŸ¤¯ <em>(I know, it's getting a bit silly now).</em></p>

<p>I didn't watch all of the sessions, as had to juggle work commitments. Virtual conferences are a bit odd - whilst Umbraco did an excellent job with it - there is a lot of time sat at a computer, I look forward to <abbr title="In Real Life">IRL</abbr> conferences.</p>

<p>Friday morning was the Umbraco Package Awards... and by complete surprise, my <a href="https://our.umbraco.com/packages/backoffice-extensions/contentment/">Contentment</a> package <a href="https://umbraco.com/blog/umbraco-package-awards-2021-the-winners/#:~:text=Best%20Editor%20Experience">won in the <strong>Best Editor Experience</strong> category!</a></p>

<p>Saturday family movie night got postponed again, as KK had a camp out at her friends.</p>

<p>The weekend was relaxed, bits of gardening on Saturday, followed by our local Open Mic in the park in the afternoon <em>(socially distanced, of course)</em>. In the evening, another campfire in the field. Sunday, went around to Lucy's sisters at the farm, <em>(for any old friends, the farm where we had <a href="/2018/08/fortyfest/">FortyFest</a>)</em>.</p>

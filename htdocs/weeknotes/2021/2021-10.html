<p>Could this be, a glimmer of the return to "normality"? KK's last week of remote learning, back to "in person" school on Monday, <em>(that's today, at the time of writing, bah to my self-imposed Sunday evening deadlines!)</em>.</p>

<p>It was a funny moment when LL returned to school last Monday, my initial reaction was to rejoice, <em>hurrah!</em> A small piece of my freedom returned. By lunch, I remembered that we usually sat down to eat whilst watching old quiz shows on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge_(TV_channel)">Challenge TV</a>, like Catchphrase or Wheel of Fortune, (all very dated), and I felt a pang of sadness that LL wasn't there to enjoy this with us, as she usually did.</p>

<p>Tuesday, Lucy completed the jigsaw we'd started the week before, I say completed, there was 1 missing piece! Although we later found out that Lucy's dad had it. He'd been wondering which jigsaw this random sky-blue piece had came from, mystery solved.</p>

<p>Wednesday, My mum had her first COVID-19 vaccine. <em>Another small piece of returning to "normality".</em> üß©‚ù§</p>

<p>My neighbour lent me <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Harry_Hill_Movie">The Harry Hill Movie</a> on DVD, which itself is funny as my DVD player has been packed in a box since I moved house over 3 years ago! I used to love watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Hill%27s_TV_Burp">TV Burp</a>, my neighbour recommended that it was one for the whole family... and he wasn't wrong, it's a dreadful story, cringe-worthy gags, plenty of facepalm moments... <strong>we loved it! ü§£</strong> <em>(I say we. KK made a swift exit halfway through, she'd had enough of the cringe.)</em> The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqpN5c6JX0E">chicken scene</a> just cracked me up, hilarious!</p>

<p>Thursday, KK was desperate to start <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe:_Phase_Three">Phase Three of the <abbr title="Marvel Cinematic Universe">MCU</abbr></a>, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_America:_Civil_War">Captain America: Civil War</a> - which is pretty much an Avengers movie. KK is loving these movies, picking up on all the fan-service references, (some of which I'm only noticing after a few viewings).</p>

<p>Lucy and I have started watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_May_Destroy_You">I May Destroy You</a> on <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000jyxy">BBC iPlayer</a>. It'd been something that I heard a lot about, had loads of good reviews and press, but I'd put off because I thought subject-wise it'd be too heavy. So far, (we're about 4 episodes in), it has a good balance of humour to offset the darker moments.</p>

<p>Friday, the day for the next letter in <b>Alphabet Albums</b>. Selections for "F" are: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7m7F7SQ3BXvIpvOgjW51Gp">Fun - Some Nights</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/09x8pmOWOTkd9da665HLwc">Frazier Chorus - Sue</a>, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5sk3ucGQiM4YHOqCGb28IR">The Faint - Wet From Birth</a>.</a></p>

<p>Saturday family movie night was KK's choice... <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire_(film)">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</a>. This is the first of them that is rated 12, LL felt a bit awkward about watching a movie that she "shouldn't be watching", but given she'd played the LEGO game and already knew most of the story, it was less of a risk. To be honest, the most noticeable things were Ron saying "Bloody Hell!" a few more times than usual.</p>

<p>Sunday, Mothering Sunday. ‚ù§ Much love and respect to all your mothers!</p>

<p>Jigsaws. Nothing this week. But I have been experimenting with the idea of doing a time-lapse video of completing a jigsaw. Trying to figure out how to best tackle it was a struggle, turns out that the built-in time-lapse feature on my Android phone (Pixel 4a) has a limit of 20 minutes. I tried using my old GoPro (HERO4 Session), but the resulting video felt janky. After searching and searching, I found an Android app called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Nishant.Singh.DroidTimelapse">Framelapse</a>, which seems to do the job well. Here's <a href="https://youtu.be/FH8F0jl-NM8">my test footage</a>...</p>

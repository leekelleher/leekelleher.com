<p>Noticing how I start off these weeknotes with a comment on how the past week has been a struggle, I can see a pattern emerging with me. Mondays, I try to get back into a work mindset - except my current work is somewhat lacking, both in substance and motivation - that is, along with juggling the kids' home-school schedule. Tuesdays, I feel awful. Guilt. Probably why I keep having those "what day is it again?" moments. By Wednesday, I've given myself a kick up the backside and feel that I have a grip on things again, an optimism. Thursdays, Fridays, I feel fine, but then the weekend breaks routine and I find myself back at the start of a vicious cycle. <em>C'est la vie.</em></p>

<p>Whilst we're on a downer, here comes the <strong>"Dad joke of the week"</strong>...</p>

<p>Thursday, back to the dentist, <em>(oh, should have made the "tooth-hurty" joke instead!)</em>, for what I thought would be another impression taken for the implant, oh no, it was the implant itself. I'm not sure how I didn't know in advance, (I blame lockdown; convenient scapegoat), but I was not prepared for it. I knew I'd be numbed up, so no physical pain, but still the thought of drilling and stitches didn't fill me with a warm happy feeling. The implant screw/socket thing all went fine, was done within an hour, no pain, just a bit achy once the novocaine had worn off. Spent most of the day in bed, sleeping it off, <em>(any excuse!)</em></p>

<p>Friday evening was our local monthly <a href="https://youtu.be/9q3dt_2ynZ0">Yatton 'Skype' Open Mic Night</a>! <em>(It's actually on Zoom.)</em> My band didn't do any songs for this one, but I did do a few of the compering links. Good fun to do something different and creative.</p>

<p><abbr title="Marvel Cinematic Universe">MCU</abbr> time! Not to give any spoilers with the episode 5 of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WandaVision">WandaVision</a>, let's say that I'm excited and intrigued about how future stories will open up and tie together. KK hasn't mentioned carrying on with Phase 2 movies yet.</p>

<p>At the weekend, we went out for a family walk - as we'd got out of the habit of our daily walks - so took a longer walk to make up for it, <em>that's how it works, right?</em></p>

<p>Saturday family movie night was KK's choice... <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulan_(2020_film)">Mulan</a> (the new live action version). It was one of those that I wasn't too interested in seeing, but KK was eager so we gave it a go. As usual, Disney deliver, ended up being an enjoyable adventure/action movie. As I'm getting older, any emotional father/daughter scenes pull on my heart string! <em>Huh? tears? oh, my eye was itchy.</em></p>

<p>Sunday, after months of (infrequent) searching for the "last Gold Brick", LL and I have 100% completed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Harry_Potter:_Years_1%E2%80%934">Lego Harry Potter</a> (Years 1‚Äì4) on the Wii! <em>(Yes, I still have a Wii.)</em> If you're familiar with it, (or any of the LEGO-themed movie games), you'll know how frustrating and time consuming it is to find all the last little bits and pieces. LL was super happy that we got 100%, <em>(and could play as Lord Voldemort!)</em></p>

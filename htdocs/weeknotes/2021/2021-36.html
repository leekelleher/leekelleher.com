<p>It feels like non-stop work, work, work for the past month or so. I'm still a few weeks behind with publishing my weeknotes. Fortunately, I kept making rough notes, so I can write them up whenever I get the chance. I'm looking forward to completing my current work projects, I've noticed my energy for other hobbies (band practice, open-source/Umbraco projects) has been zapped, (others have noticed this too). Feeling like my home/work life balance needs calibrating again.</p>

<p>Had a mix of weather over the past week, first few days were very sunny, pretty much how it was during July. Then last few days, the rain hit. I did try to make the most of the sunnier days, sat out in the field with a cuppa.</p>

<p>Tuesday, the season finale of the <a href="https://packagemanifest.fm/episodes/010-finale" target="_blank">Package Manifest podcast</a> came out. I joined other Umbraco community members to chat about the previous episodes and future topics for season 2.</p>

<p>I've been reminded of a track to add to my Spotify playlists. <a href="https://www.thissongplantstrees.com/"><strong>This Song Plants Trees.</strong></a></p>

<p><b>Alphabet Albums</b>, for "S" we went with... <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0jthc9ezftxi0w1jyhZfgi">Saint Etienne - So Tough</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/37W5zHuHoN8hU4WVkjSEJD">School Of Seven Bells - Alpinisms</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/58RP9ZGsr39HptJZLaVvm4">Scissor Sisters - Scissor Sisters</a>.</p>

<p>Friday night was the <a href="https://www.yeovalleylions.org.uk/cbf2.html">Claverham Beer Festival</a>. It'd been cancelled in 2020 <em>(of course)</em>, and re-scheduled from July 2021. It's a great local event to support local breweries, whilst socialising with local mates, to fundraise for local charities... and the beer wasn't too bad either! üòâ</p>

<p>Saturday afternoon, we'd organised a <a href="https://codecab.in/">CODECABIN</a> virtual reunion. I ended up missing it. <em>(Partly hungover, partly family responsibilities, partly my bad planning, overall just me being rubbish.)</em> ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

<p>Saturday family movie night was my choice... classic Jim Carrey, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mask_(1994_film)">The Mask</a>! Initially, the kids weren't too impressed by my choice, but ended up laughing throughout.</p>

<p>Sunday, we went for brunch at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thepearorchardltd/">The Pear Orchard</a> (in Kingston Seymour), weather was much better than the previous time we went, good food, good vibes.</p>

<p>Counting down the days until the schools fully reopen, (8<sup>th</sup> March). Although, while I'm looking forward to regaining some "normality", I'm sure I'll miss them being around all day.</p>

<p>Previous week, I made a <a href="https://twitter.com/leekelleher/status/1362326250136752129">tweet about the latest Umbraco install stats</a>, <em>(it's going in the right direction)</em>, this triggered a follow up conversation with <a href="https://twitter.com/lsiversen">Lars</a> from Umbraco about historical stats and HQ's efforts moving forwards. All part of the evolution of a maturing CMS.</p>

<p>Started watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Serpent_(TV_series)">The Serpent</a> on <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08zh4ts">BBC iPlayer</a>. Reminict of our own backpacking experiences, making friends with everyone, it is scary how you could easily fall into being decieved, <em>(or worse)</em>. I remembered about the time we were in Bali and a driver was acting very suspuctious, anything could have happened. <a href="https://www.lee-and-lucy.com/travelblog/2002/12/12/dolphins-and-snorkeling/">We wrote about our Bali experiences on our old travelblog</a>.</p>

<p>Since completing LEGO Harry Potter, (in <a href="https://leekelleher.com/weeknotes/2021/W05/">Week 05</a>), I'd been playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Indiana_Jones:_The_Original_Adventures">LEGO Indiana Jones</a> with LL. Tuesday evening we were so close to completing it 100%, so we agreed to get up early Wednesday morning and finish it off.</p>

<p>Finally cancelled my mobile phone contract with EE. I'd been with them since 2006, (well started with T-Mobile), never really had any problems with them, but recent years price increases and additional charges just got a bit too much, so have moved over to <a href="https://www.giffgaff.com/orders/affiliate/leeke27450">GiffGaff</a>, (similar package for a third of the price!) Kept my same number, all seamless.</p>

<p>Caught up with <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbrailsford">Matt</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/lucybrailsford">Lucy</a> about <a href="https://codecab.in/">CODECABIN</a>. Figuring out the possible logistics of doing it this year, with COVID-19 there are so many factors to consider. First and foremost is the safety of our CODECABIN guests.</p>

<p>Friday was also the day for the next letter in <b>Alphabet Albums</b>. Selections for "E" are: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7sqwuxORaCogFGgygafdSt">Eels - Beautiful Freak </a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6tkEXRxw7AJiqc6hM37rnD">Ezio - Black Boots On Latin Feet</a>, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2widuo17g5CEC66IbzveRu">The Eagles - Hotel California</a>. Alphabet Albums seems to be inspiring others, <a href="https://twitter.com/ravimotha/status/1365241893475520512">Ravi has been making suggestions too!</a></p>

<p>Stumbled upon a website called <a href="https://odesli.co/">Songlink/Odesli</a> that gathers all the link for various services for a particular song or album. For the Alphabet Albums I've been linking to Spotify as that's what I use, but the Songlink embed offers links to the available alternatives too.</p>

<p>Here's the one for The Eagles - Hotel California. <iframe width="100%" height="52" src="https://embed.song.link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Falbum.link%2Fi%2F635770200&theme=light" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-presentation allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox" loading="lazy"></iframe></p>

<p>Received a letter from the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/"><abbr title="Information Commissioner's Office">ICO</abbr></a>, stating that my company hadn't paid a Data Protection fee. Which was the first time I was hearing about such a fee. I don't think it applies to us, but will follow up during the next week.</p>

<p>Saturday family movie night was LL's choice, and she finally picked... <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocahontas_(1995_film)">Pocahontas</a>, <em>(see <a href="https://leekelleher.com/weeknotes/2021/W03/">Week 03</a> for relevance)</em>. I'm not sure if I was feeling tired, but I struggled to connect with the characters and story, felt a bit meh. Kids seemed to enjoy it though.</p>

<p>No jigsaws or collages this week. I guess I am tired.<br><em>(I hadn't even mentioned <abbr title="Marvel Cinematic Universe">MCU</abbr> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WandaVision">WandaVision</a> this week!)</em> ðŸ˜‰</p>

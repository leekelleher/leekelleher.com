<p>The week started with a dentist appointment to get an x-ray and impression for a potential implant, (had a tooth extract a few months ago). Back again early February for further impression and tooth modelling.</p>

<p>Slowly getting back into the swing with work. Still working from the dining table, I haven't braved my garage-office yet, (too cold). Built a couple of nice features for the <a href="https://neonfutures.org.uk/">Neon</a> platform.</p>

<p>In the muddle of work and the kid's remote-learning, everyday has become lockdown groundhog day. I spent most of Wednesday thinking it was Tuesday (almost to the point of argument), then Thursday felt like Wednesday, and Friday who knows. Days lost, sanity questioned.</p>

<p>I've been enjoying hacking around on my personal website. I've ripped out the static site generator and gone back to hand-coding with good old HTML, CSS and PHP. Put together a page for <a href="/jigsaws/">the jigsaws I've completed</a>. In the spirit of learning, I took a look at <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a> for making the Jigsaws page. I gave it a couple of hours, but cognitively struggled with getting the syntax in my head, spent more time searching the reference documentation - so sacked it off, went with plain old trustworthy CSS. I wanted something up there fast. I'm sure Tailwind is super productive for those who've invested the time, alas, maybe next time.</p>

<p>I'm feeling quite comfortable with my personal website being a mess, by that I mean <i>unstructured</i>. For many years I wanted to have an over-arching structure for the whole website, but that lead me to a long road of procrastination. My current idea is to have a collection of microsites for my various interests.</p>

<p>Successfully avoided any <abbr title="Marvel Cinematic Universe">MCU</abbr> movies this week, much to the disappointment of KK. Probably a few more days until I cave in. Watched the final few episodes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_(TV_series)">The Fall</a> - 3rd series felt slow, but overall enjoyed it, more interested in the psychiatric aspects than the drama.</p>

<p>Friday was the day for the next letter in <b>Alphabet Albums</b>. Selections for "B" are: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/42pR7OqqmNYoTCZA1wSUwl?si=LbpcBeWtSI-GZdja6wQO7w">Blancmange - Wanderlust</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/26FKdtGtzmB4jsPgIjfvjD?si=CgZWbuE_RMWE_RqN6PAj3g">The Brilliant Corners - Somebody Up There Likes Me</a>, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3PRoXYsngSwjEQWR5PsHWR?si=k2MZUMwIRCS4D1BH7i1Pqg">The Beatles - Revolver</a>.</p>

<p>Not too much went on at the weekend, spent most of Saturday out in the garden - sounds idyllic, well if de-weeding, pruning and shifting paving stones takes your fancy. Good to be outside though.</p>

<p>Saturday family movie night, we attempted to watch Bristol Old Vic's "At Home" performance of <a href="https://bristololdvic.org.uk/whats-on/swallows-and-amazons">Swallows and Amazons</a>, but we hit buffering problems, (not sure if it was a Chromecast issue or something else, we'll try again next week), so we paused it and watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets_(film)">Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</a> instead, (it's LL's first time watching the series, she was very excited).</p>

<p>Sunday, quiet day - had planned on a jigsaw, but ended up mucking around on the piano, re-learning some old Beatles tunes, like The Fool on the Hill.</p>

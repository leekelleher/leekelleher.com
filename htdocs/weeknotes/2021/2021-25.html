<p>Last week started off with my rescheduled trip to the dentist to have an impression taken for a replacement crown. I'll go back in 3 weeks time for the fitting.</p>

<p>Mostly been focused on client work, rolling out new features and updates on <a href="https://neonfutures.org.uk/">Neon Futures</a> for EngineeringUK.</p>

<p>Thursday, I finally started recording my bass parts for our album. We have 9 songs to do, it's going to take a while to get them all done and finalised. Hopefully, we can release it around autumn time.</p>

<p>Also on Thursday, I noticed a small note sticking out of the letter box, TNT saying they'd attempted to deliver something, but no one home, <em>(I was, but in my office)</em>, so they'd try again Friday. I hadn't ordered anything recently, so no idea what it would be. Searched up the tracking reference number, nada, no info about it, no idea what time it'd be re-delivered. So Friday, I worked from the dining table, TNT delivered around noon, and it was... <strong>my Umbraco package award statue!</strong></p>

<p>Saturday. We had another full band practice. Went through all the songs, sounding tight, rocking away!</p>

<p>Saturday family movie night was my choice... <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_Family">Instant Family</a> on Netflix. I say my choice, but I made a trade with KK for last week's Spiderman movie. Instant Family was alright, funny in places and sentimental. Few too many curse words, nothing too bad - it was rated 12, (and LL is 10), and we try not go <abbr title="Over The Top">OTT</abbr> on censorship, but the frequency of minor swearing was noticeable. Apart from that, it's still a good (older kids) family movie.</p>

<p>Sunday turned out to be eventful. In the morning, Lucy and I had our second COVID-19 vaccination jab. ðŸŽ‰ In the afternoon, LL's first cricket tournament got cancelled due to the rain, so Lucy and LL went to poultry sale at a local village hall, and we now have 7 new hens! We still have 3 hens left from the original batch - so we needed to segregate them for the next 2 weeks. A few spare pallets and left-over chicken wire, we built a wall! <em>(Don't worry little ones, you'll soon be free and united!)</em></p>

<p>Later in the afternoon, KK got a message from a school friend saying they'd tested positive for COVID-19. That's an automatic 10-day self-isolation, and we're back to remote-learning again. <em>(Oh hello Microsoft Teams! We haven't missed you!)</em> KK did a lateral flow test last night, it's negative, but secretly I think she likes the idea of hiding in her bedroom for the next 10 days. ðŸ˜†</p>

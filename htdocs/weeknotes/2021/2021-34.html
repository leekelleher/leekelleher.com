Monday

Pontins Prestatyn. My worst nightmare. Lasted 3 hours, then I headed to Liverpool.

Stopped by where I used to live when I was 3yo. Lovely little village called Northop. I didn't recognise any of it. Looked nice though.


Tuesday

I met Dad for lunch, and walked around Sefton Park.


Wednesday

I met Dan for lunch, at the Tavern Co. for a big breakfast.


Thursday

Met Dad again in the afternoon, round Sefton Park again.


Friday

Roxy Music - Roxy Music

Went back to Pontins Prestatyn to pick Lucy and the girls up.
Waterfall, ice creams.


Saturday

Went into Liverpool city centre with my mum and girls. I'm not used to so many people!
I wasn't before, but post-COVID, OMG too much.


Sunday

Met up with Dad in the afternoon.


Bank Holiday Monday

Egg in tyre.

Walk around Sefton Park (again)
Saw Paul Hagan.

Drove home.

<p>I'd started with the week off with a bit of coding. Since <a href="https://dev.to/mattbrailsford/fixing-analyzer-problems-in-multi-targeted-umbraco-packages-3ijk">Matt has been talking about multi-targeting Umbraco packages</a>, I'd been toying with the idea of doing the same with <a href="https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment">Contentment</a>. My initial thought had been to abandon v8 compatibility once v9 came out, but there was always a niggle that v8 support may be needed for a while longer, and I didn't want the headache of supporting two codebases. It's a work-in-progress, but so far it's looking good.</p>

<p>Monday evening we had band practice, (I think our last one was in June), long overdue! It was great to go through all the songs again.</p>

<p>The rest of the week has been work, work, work, work. My current projects are due to launch during October. Then I can breathe. Meh.</p>

<p>TV wise, I started watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Horror_Stories">American Horror Stories</a> (on Disney+). It's a spin-off show from American Horror Story, which I haven't watched. But I do like a horror anthology show, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_from_the_Darkside">Tales from the Darkside</a> / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_the_Unexpected_(TV_series)">Tales of the Unexpected</a> are right up my street. It's been good so far, maybe a little like an adult version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goosebumps_(TV_series)">Goosebumps</a>, still watchable.</p>

<p>Thursday, I found out about <a href="https://1001albumsgenerator.com/">a website inspired by the book <strong>1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die</strong></a>. It auto-selects an album each day for you. Which has been great for me, as I often end up re-listening to the same music over and over again. So far, there has been a good mix of music genres, <a href="https://1001albumsgenerator.com/shares/614dc96c27361745b5ad4629">here's my listening summary</a>.</p>

<p>Speaking of albums, it's <b>Alphabet Albums</b> time again, next up was "T"... <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2wnq5e000z2hT7qS2F8jZ5">T-Rex - Electric Warrior</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7FwAtuhhWivxvK4aPgyyUD">They Might Be Giants - Flood</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1AckkxSo39144vOBrJ1GkS">Tenacious D - Tenacious D</a>.</p>

<p>Friday evening I challenged Lucy to a "jigsaw off" - <em>I'm not sure what that even means?! Maybe like a dance-off but with jigsaws?</em> A race to see who could complete a 500 piece jigsaw first. Lucy did the <a href="/jigsaws/#5012269031232">Clifton Bridge jigsaw</a> that I did last week, and I tackled this one...</p>

<p>...and frustratingly, Lucy beat me by about 20 minutes! Bah! <em>Next time, next time!</em></p>

<p>The weekend was lots of gardening again. It's the end of summer, so one of those that if you don't do certain things now the growth will be overwhelming next year. Saturday evening, I decided to avoid the new series of Strictly Come Dancing, <em>(I can't be arsed with it this year),</em> so went out to the field to burn some garden waste... and have a few beers... and listen to some music... until the early hours of Sunday morning... to the annoyance of my neighbours. ðŸ˜¬</p>

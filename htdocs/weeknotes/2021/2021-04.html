<p>I must admit it's been a struggle writing up this weeknote, I kept putting it off. The past week had been tougher, cabin fever kicked in. <em>Remember to breathe, look after yourself.</em> <cite><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6wnmRxEbwUK7WLyUtiRuT7">Fitter happier. More productive. Comfortable. Not drinking too much.</a></cite></p>

<p>For most of the week, I didn't watch any TV shows or movies - maybe because in writing these weeknotes I realise how much TV I was watching? Not sure. On the positive side, we did play more family games in the evenings.</p>

<p>We did a series of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downfall_(game)">Downfall</a> play-offs, <em>(not the crappy modern version, but Lucy's original blue version from the 80s! Nostalgia!)</em> Ultimately, Lucy won, LL came 2<sup>nd</sup>, with KK and I in joint 3<sup>rd</sup>.</p>

<p>Oh, the TV did get turned on, on Thursday morning... <a href="https://twitter.com/MyPortraitProj">my cousin Charlotte</a> was featured on <a href="https://youtu.be/HUZnOFmQcvc">ITV's This Morning</a> talking about her <a href="https://www.myportraitproject.co.uk/">celebrity LEGO portraits</a>! üëèüëèüëè</p>

<p>Uh-oh, it's <strong>"Dad joke of the week"</strong> time...</p>

<p>Paid my personal tax bill - tends to pain me, <em>I mean, yes, paying tax is a good thing</em>, think it's more that bitter pill to swallow at the start of the year! On a positive note, Beatles' <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4BRkPBUxOYffM2QXVlq7aC">Taxman</a> always gets stuck in my head - great song!</p>

<p>Friday, I had a call with <a href="https://twitter.com/Filipbech">Filip</a> from Umbraco for a general chat and my thoughts on support for legacy releases - sparked from <a href="https://twitter.com/leekelleher/status/1353997701348810752">a tweet I made earlier in the week</a>. Good feedback all round.</p>

<p>Friday was also the day for the next letter in <b>Alphabet Albums</b>. Selections for "C" are: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5lEphbceIgaK1XxWeSrC9E">Cocteau Twins - Heaven or Las Vegas</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/50ro1Uk0loQWurWVsU6leJ">The Chills - Submarine Bells</a>, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4ILt0IpjcGEEpXOotZ7dDY">Johnny Cash - The Rambler</a>.</p>

<p>re: <abbr title="Marvel Cinematic Universe">MCU</abbr>, <em>(because I've mentioned it every week now)</em>, the latest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WandaVision">WandaVision</a> episode was the only one I watched. Enjoying where the story is heading.</p>

<p>I did a jigsaw on Saturday afternoon...</p>

<p>Saturday family movie night was Lucy's choice... <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban_(film)">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a>. Re-watching the films closer together, it's incredible seeing how much the actors age between them. Great movie, one of my favourites out of the series.</p>

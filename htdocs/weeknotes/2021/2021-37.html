<p>It'd been another week of work, work, work, work. It must be slightly easing up though, as I found a bit of time to play bass and do a bit of open-source coding.</p>

<p>For my Umbraco plug-in, <a href="https://our.umbraco.com/packages/backoffice-extensions/contentment/">Contentment</a>, I <a href="https://twitter.com/leekelleher/status/1438967393108307975">tweeted a quick demo</a> of a preview for a new display editor called <a href="https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment/pull/133">Templated Label</a>.</p>

<p>Saturday, Lucy took us into Bristol for a surprise... a visit to the <a href="https://www.historyofvideogames.co.uk/">History of Video Games</a> arcade at the Galleries. I got to reminisce and show the girls all the old computers and consoles I used to have and play on. They quickly got bored of that and wanted to play all the retro games. LL took a liking to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streets_of_Rage_2">Streets of Rage 2</a> on the Sega Mega Drive, and KK enjoyed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Dance_Revolution">Dance Dance Revolution</a> - of which I found myself feeling very unfit! ðŸ˜†</p>

<p>Saturday family movie night was LL's choice... <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cats_%26_Dogs">Cats &amp; Dogs</a>.</p>

<p>Sunday, did a bit of gardening - well butchered a hedge, and managed to fit in a 500 piece jigsaw.</p>

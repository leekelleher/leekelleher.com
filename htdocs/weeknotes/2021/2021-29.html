<p>Heatwave in the UK. Too hot to spend a minute longer than necessary in my office. Week 28's notes had to wait a little longer.</p>

<p>KK was doing another 10-day self-isolation stint. Negative results on her lateral flow tests throughout the week. School finished on the Wednesday, but she had to isolate until Sunday.</p>

<p>Saturday family movie night was KK's choice... <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luca_(2021_film)">Luca</a> on Disney+. I've mentioned before that I'm quite sceptical of the newer Disney/Pixar movies - probably because I worry about quantity over quality - churning out animated movies at a scheduled factory production line pace. As usual, I'm happy to be wrong, Luca was a good family movie, we all enjoyed it.</p>

<p>The kids wanted me to watch a trailer for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raya_and_the_Last_Dragon">Raya and the Last Dragon</a> (also on Disney+), as a potential for a future movie night. It looked quite good. I told KK that the martial art bits reminded me of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crouching_Tiger,_Hidden_Dragon">Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</a>. She was curious, so we ended up watching it later on. It's still an excellent movie, one of my favourites, hasn't dated.</p>

<p>Sunday night, to celebrate the end of KK's 2<sup>nd</sup> self-isolation, I took her to watch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Widow_(2021_film)">Black Widow</a> at the <a href="https://www.curzon.org.uk/">Curzon cinema (Clevedon)</a>. Great to be able to go back to the cinema!</p>

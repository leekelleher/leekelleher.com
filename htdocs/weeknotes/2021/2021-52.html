<p>Nope, it wasn't a 24-hour flu thing. It turned into a 7-day bedridden flu thing! Still worried that it might be COVID, I was doing daily lateral flow tests, all negative. Going for a PCR test kept getting suggested, but I was already bedridden - feeling dreadful, stuck in bed, doubt I could drive myself for a PCR, I was self-isolating anyway, I stayed in bed. In terms of NHS track-and-trace, Lucy had already told everyone we'd seen in the past 48-hours. I've no idea who I got the flu from.</p>

<p>The unfortunate side of getting ill is that we had to cancel our family visit to Liverpool - our 2<sup>nd</sup> Christmas. I felt bad for my family. Re-scheduled for when I'd recovered.</p>

<p>I pretty much spent most of the week sleeping. When not sleeping, I managed to watch a few movies <em>(if I could keep my eyes open long enough)</em>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Look_Up_(2021_film)">Don't Look Up</a>, <em>(realistic, interesting, but daft)</em>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Short">The Big Short</a>, <em>(informative, engaging and terrifying)</em>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumanji:_The_Next_Level">Jumanji: The Next Level</a>, <em>(daft, good fun)</em>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddington_2">Paddington 2</a>, <em>(great, enjoyed a lot)</em>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_Life_(TV_series)">Back To Life: Series 2</a>, <em>(was okay)</em>; and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortimer_%26_Whitehouse:_Gone_Fishing">Mortimer & Whitehouse: Gone Christmas Fishing</a>, <em>(lovely)</em>. </p>

<p>New Year's Eve, I started to feel a bit better, not quite 100%, but managed to get out of a bed for a bit.</p>

<p>New Year's Day, I sat our in the garden for a couple of hours - it was freezing, but after a week stuck in bed, I needed to be out in the fresh (cold) air for a while.</p>

<p>So that's the end of 2021. I'd managed to stick with writing up my weeknotes, <em>(with the exception of weeks 34/35)</em>, which I'm quite happy about. Even if it has mostly been about what movies and music I'd been listening to, it was still good to keep a journal each week. <strong>Will I continue this in 2022?</strong> My current thought is no. I feel that I should focus my writing/energies on other things, whether that be articles or coding - but still keep to a regular schedule.</p>

<p>What I do know is that 2022 will be a different year for me, with many changes ahead.</p>

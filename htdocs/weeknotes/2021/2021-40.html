<p>First thing Monday morning we were at school, sending LL off for a week long trip to <a href="http://www.morfabay.com/">Morfa Bay Adventure</a>. It's not the first time she'd been away from home without us, but still felt quite emotional. Odd without her being around all week.</p>

<p>Tuesday, I got a new release of <a href="https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment/releases/tag/2.2.0">Contentment out, v2.2.0</a> - couple of new features and bug fixes. Also updated the v3.0 alpha release for Umbraco v9. I'm slowly working towards unifying the releases to support but Umbraco v8 and v9.</p>

<p>Finished up on Squid Game, I enjoy it, but still intense. I was looking for something more light-hearted to watch. A few of my mates had been suggesting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detectorists">The Detectorists</a> for a while - I gave it a go. First episode was alright, but the second episode - those Simon &amp; Garfunkel gags cracked me up!</p>

<p>Thursday evening, bored of TV, did another jigsaw...</p>

<p>I received a parcel from Umbraco HQ... an axe! I'm not entirely sure why they sent me an axe, but thank you all the same, I appreciate it. <a href="https://twitter.com/leekelleher/status/1446367494172782631">Tweeted a photo of me shaving with it.</a></p>

<p>Friday, <b>Alphabet Albums</b> - we've been struggling with this over the past few weeks, the fortnights are flying by. We're up to "U"... <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/33u6is8z7qjIuRfUruzNpp">Up, Bustle &amp; Out - Light 'Em Up, Blow 'Em Out</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0b8aN5YAdL4zBAQxNc30Uf">The Unthanks - Mount the Air</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5n52kyQKeUZs5ObZJejLQd">U2 - Achtung Baby</a>.</p>

<p>LL came home from Morfa Bay, totally exhausted. All she wanted to do was play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streets_of_Rage_2">Streets of Rage 2</a> with me (on the Wii's Sega Mega Drive emulator). Funny how it goes.</p>

<p>Friday night my neighbour and I had a little gathering in our field. Music, banter and campfire. I may have got to bed around 4am, eek!</p>

<p>Saturday was a complete write off. I'm getting too old for hangovers.</p>

<p>Our regular Saturday family movie nights have been put on-hold, since the kids want to watch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strictly_Come_Dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a>.</p>

<p>Sunday, went for a lovely walk around the woodlands of <a href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/tyntesfield">Tyntesfield (National Trust)</a>. Gorgeous weather for October. By complete coincidence, bumped into <a href="https://twitter.com/chudders">James</a> and family, who I'd not seen in about 5 years!</p>

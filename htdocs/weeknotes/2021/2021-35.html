Bank holiday (see last week's notes)


Tuesday

Work, work, work.

Router in my office finally went kerput - so no wifi in my office, can still connect to the house wifi, but it's weak.
Reverted back to using the Surface Dock with the Ethernet port, we'll see how long it works before I throw it out of the window again!


Wednesday

USB Ethernet arrived, been working fine. But lack of wifi in the office has had knock on effects.


Thursday

work work work

Friday

Recorded Package Manifest podcast with Matt and Kevin.

First time I'd been back since the new landlord. Not sure if Open Mic will come back yet, or move to a different pub?

<p>I'm late again writing up these weeknotes, I'll explain next week.<br>
<em>(That's just how these weeknotes work.)</em></p>

<p>Lucy and LL went away camping, KK stayed at home with me for a couple more days - her self-isolation finished on the Sunday, so she wanted Monday to catch up with her mates before heading off to camp on the Tuesday. Teenagers are funny creatures, I foolishly thought any usual angst would settle with just two of us in the house, but the typical <em>"urgh, I'm not eating that! I'm not hungry anyway"</em> quickly came back, guess I'm having lasagna for the rest of the week then.</p>

<p>I found a podcast to help me understand <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/64MIxhQyXxkerSgXBV6Ojy">The Wonder of The Teenagers Brain</a>. Quite insightful, many lessons to be learnt.</p>

<p>I totally forgot to mention last week that I took part in the latest <a href="https://community.umbraco.com/events/community-office-hours/">Umbraco Community Office Hours</a> webinar, it was to highlight some of the winners in the recent <a href="https://umbraco.com/blog/umbraco-package-awards-2021-the-winners/">Umbraco Package Awards.</a> The recording is <a href="https://youtu.be/RNlT8HVB5TQ?t=1850">available to watch on YouTube</a>, you can catch my demo of <a href="https://our.umbraco.com/packages/backoffice-extensions/contentment/">Contentment</a> about 30 minutes in.</p>

<p>Being home alone, there wasn't much to do in the evenings. I ended up watching all sorts of movies, some random, some that'd been on my watchlists for ages... <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tomorrow_War">The Tomorrow War</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jolt_(film)">Jolt</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_Street_Part_One:_1994">Fear Street: Part One: 1994</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_Street_Part_Two:_1978">Two: 1978</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_Street_Part_Three:_1666">Three: 1666</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Final_Girls">The Final Girls</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_House">His House</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_and_Silent_Bob_Reboot">Jay and Silent Bob Reboot</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma_(film)">Ma</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Grade_(film)">Eighth Grade</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moxie_(film)">Moxie</a>. A few?! Jeepers, that's a lot of movies!</p>

<p>But, I'm not one to completely sit and zonk out, I tried multi-tasking. Did a jigsaw whilst watching the movies.</p>

	<figcaption>I Love Paris. 1000 piece jigsaw. Took about 6 hours, over 2 evenings, while watching movies.</figcaption>

<p>Friday was my birthday. 43 years old, all alone, woe is me. üòú<br>
<em>Wait a minute? What's that noise?</em> I hear something from the side of the house. <em>Surprise!</em> Lucy and the girls returned from camp for a birthday surprise visit. üéâ</p>

<p>In the evening, I had planned for a small get together in our field with a few friends and neighbours. I put the feelers out, but most friends were either busy or away on holiday - it was looking like it'd just be me and Sam (next door neighbour) - and with Lucy and kids being back I was 50/50 on cancelling that, to have a family night in, but Lucy insisted I go down the field. The weather was looking indecisive, would it rain or not? Sam, suggested putting up a shelter tent just in case - okay, sure - I went down to help get set up. But I kept being called back to the house by the kids, with very random requests, <em>("Dad, can you help me find my crocs?" - find some other shoes!)</em> ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.<br>
By the time I got back down to the field...<br><br>
<strong>"SURPRISE!"</strong><br><br>
All those mates who were busy or away, were there - tricksy devils! üòÜ I hadn't had a surprise party before, I honestly had no idea how to react. I'm amazed that I had no idea, it was a lovely surprise and a great evening. A mini-<a href="/2018/08/fortyfest/">FortyFest</a>, a <strong>43Fest</strong> so to speak.</p>

<p>Saturday and Sunday were a write-off. Lucy and the girls headed back to camp for the 2<sup>nd</sup> week.</p>

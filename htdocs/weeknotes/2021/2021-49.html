<p><em>I'm late in writing up my week note. Don't get too excited, not much happened this week.</em> ðŸ˜†</p>

<p>I finally ordered a <a href="https://www.gigaclear.com/">Gigaclear</a> package, (400Mpbs for Â£20/month, one of these Cyber Monday deals). Gigaclear has dug up our road last year to install all the "fibre to the house" infrastructure. They initially offered a 6-months free package, but I had recently renewed on a 12-months contract with Plusnet. I could have bought myself out of it, but decided to stick with it until it expired... which is at the end of this month, so good timing for a Gigaclear switch over. Full Fibre will be installed on the 22<sup>nd</sup> Dec.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.strawberrylinecafe.co.uk/">Strawberry Line Cafe</a> celebrated their 11<sup>th</sup> birthday. Lucy &amp; I went down for lunch and cake.</p>

<p>At the weekend, we were invited to a friend's Christmas dinner get together, (at the <a href="https://www.whitehart-wrington.co.uk/">White Hart in Wrington</a> We weren't originally invited, due to number restrictions, but one of the other families had to drop out due to COVID self-isolation. Silly Christmas jumpers were worn, and we got to miss the Strictly semi-final! ðŸ˜†</p>

<p>Sunday, my procrastination of Christmas present shopping led me to doing another jigsaw puzzle.</p>

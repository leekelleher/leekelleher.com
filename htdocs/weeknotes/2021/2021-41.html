<p>Strange week, I'd been feeling out of sorts. I decided to not work from my office at the start of the week - kind of a "working from home" at home, sort of thing.</p>

<p>I've been enjoying the <a href="https://1001albumsgenerator.com/">1001 Albums generator</a> that I mentioned a couple of weeks back. It's been an interesting mix of music that I already knew, but also some hidden gems. I've been enjoying <a href="https://1001albumsgenerator.com/albums/7Hk9jGHupUwHa0JXQr8m0F/clube-da-esquina">Milton Nascimento's Clube Da Esquina</a>, something I doubt I'd ever have discovered on my own.</p>

<p>Wednesday evening, our local open-mic night started back up again. I ended up not going, I wasn't feeling too good, (kind of felt like pre-flu aches, or maybe I'm just exhausted?) Shame though as I was really looking forward to it, practised a couple of covers to play. Next month!</p>

<p>Thursday, I worked back in my office. But had internet/network issues, bloomin' Ethernet didn't work. Spent a few hours trying to get it back up and running. Eventually I tried the next Ethernet port on the back of the modem and it all started working again. No idea what was up with the first Ethernet port.</p>

<p>Friday, LL was going away again! This time for the weekend at Brownies camp. More adventuring!</p>

<p>Saturday, because LL was away we could skip Strictly Come Dancing! Lucy and I went to along to the first post-lockdown <a href="https://www.facebook.com/congresburyfolkclub">Congresbury Folk Night</a>, leaving KK at home (with a friend) for a pizza &amp; movie night.</p>

<p>Sunday, Lucy's nephew's baptism. A larger family gathering that I felt comfortable with (since post-lockdown). All went well, but I didn't stay around for too long after the church.</p>

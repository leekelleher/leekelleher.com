<p>Where did the last week go? Most of my focus has been on a new phase of work for a client project, it's been full on, probably why it feels like the days have flown by.</p>

<p>I haven't spent much time on Umbraco community/package related activities this past week. My free time has mostly been bass guitar practising. Gearing closer to recording our album.</p>

<p>Friday night, I went to the pub for the first time since they re-opened. Met up with the band, planning out upcoming practices, recordings and gigs. Nice to go back to a pub, but hangovers are less nice, urgh.</p>

<p><b>Alphabet Albums</b> time, next up is "K"... <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0VyDvw4MT9XDoSzE24yBCc">Kasabian - Kasabian</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5ktMgVAJtsv4HagfFliWpR">The Kinks - Something Else</a>, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0HHRIVjvBcnTepfeRVgS2f">Kraftwerk - Trans-Europe Express</a>.</a></p>

<p>Saturday family movie night didn't happen this week. Lucy had bought a ticket for the virtual Glastonbury live-stream - yup, she got caught up in the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-57215629">frustrating "invalid code" muck up</a>. I ended up watching Eurovision anyway, love the chaos of the scoring system at the end.</p>

<p>I watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_of_the_Dead">Army of the Dead</a> on Netflix... there was some hype around it leading up to its release, and I generally like post-apocalyptic movies. It was alright, zombie heist genre mash-up, it has its moments. It tried to add a spin on the typical zombie hoards by having "alpha" zombies, which was different. The characters were likeable enough, but overall, quite predictable and a long runtime (2.5 hours), could have probably been cut by an hour.</p>

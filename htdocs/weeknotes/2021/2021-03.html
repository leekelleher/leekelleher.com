<p>These lockdown weeks seem to be getting tougher. This past week has mentally taken its toll on us - at this point I always acknowledge that we (as a family) are in a much more privileged position than others, so I shouldn't complain - although everything is relative to your own circumstances. <em>Oh, how very English of me.</em></p>

<p>Monday, I received the replacement <a href="https://adolfi.dev/blog/mvp-holiday-care-package/">Umbraco MVP New Year's gift</a>, <em>(the first one arrived in several shattered pieces, eek!)</em>, just in time for the afternoon's Umbraco HQ Hew Year webinar. Main announcement being that this year's CodeGarden will be a virtual event.</p>

<p>re: <em>(the now regular slot of)</em> <abbr title="Marvel Cinematic Universe">MCU</abbr> movies - I gave in, we watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man_3">Iron Man 3</a> on Monday night. During the week I watched the first 3 episodes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WandaVision">WandaVision</a> - I didn't watch with KK, didn't know if it'd spoil the other movies for her. WandaVision is interesting, at face value it's fun, while the underlying psycho-drama is apparent. Curious how much of the comic's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_M">House of M</a> storyline plays out in the show.</p>

<p>Tuesday was one of those weird days again where I thought it was Wednesday, lost all track of time. I wasn't feeling too great, had a stomach ache - couldn't concentrate on work, had to escape the house - went for a long walk, few miles to get some fresh air and clear my head. A good opportunity to listen to the current Alphabet Albums.</p>

<p>Wednesday <em>- the actual Wednesday - </em> I had an Umbraco MVP Connect call, covered similar to Monday's main HQ webinar, but with extra insider news - well, things that will be announced in due course, (<em>or on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-X4s_6T1SY">Friday's umbraCoffee</a>)</em>.</p>

<p>After the MVP Connect, I had a catch up with <a href="http://tooorangey.co.uk/">Marc</a>, (<em><b>Hi Marc!</b> Yes, you got a mention on my weeknotes.</em> üòÜ), chatted about family, work and editorial UX for <a href="https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment/blob/develop/docs/editors/data-list.md">Contentment Data List</a> editors. Thinking around <a href="https://medium.com/tripaneer-techblog/improving-the-usability-of-multi-selecting-from-a-long-list-63e1a67aab35">the usability of multi-selecting from a long list of options</a> - more to come on that in future <a href="https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment/">Contentment</a> releases.</p>

<p>I've been winding the kids up with corny "dad jokes", so I don't see why you (dear reader) should get off so lightly. I hereby present my dubious (and meta) <strong>"Dad joke of the week"</strong>...</p>

        <p>Is it appropriate to make a 'dad joke' if you're not a dad?<br><strong>No, it's a faux pa!</strong></p>

<p>Thursday evening, <a href="https://twitter.com/leekelleher/status/1352363845399048202">I missed the Umbraco Manchester meet-up!</a> It looked a good one, I'm always curious about insights on <em>Content Modeling</em>. In my defence, I was preparing for LL's 10th birthday... I seem to get carried away with doodling on their birthday cards.</p>

<p>Saturday we went out for a 6 mile walk, an elaborate round trip to Lucy's folks to drop off some birthday cake.</p>

<p>Saturday family movie night was LL's choice... <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilo_%26_Stitch_2:_Stitch_Has_a_Glitch">Lilo and Stitch 2</a> - she had suggest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocahontas_(1995_film)">Pocahontas</a>, <em>(which none of us have actually seen before)</em>, but she suddenly changed her mind last minute. I like the original Stitch movie, the sequel was daft, but it was only about an hour long, and it had Elvis references!</p>

<p>Once the kids were in bed, I watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Waters_(2019_film)">Dark Waters</a> - I do like a good "inspired by a true story" political/legal thriller, I'd been wanting to watch it for a while - but knew the subject matter would be quite heavy, so been putting it off. Great acting and writing, I couldn't get to sleep afterwards, the details kept playing on my mind. Will we ever understand <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/theme/the-darker-side-of-invention/dgKy8cSx6BC7LQ?hl=en">the darker impacts of our own inventions</a>, on the environment, on our humanity?</p>

<p>Been playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Indiana_Jones:_The_Original_Adventures">LEGO Indiana Jones on the Wii</a> with LL, reminiscing various scenes from the movies, so decided to watch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Last_Crusade">Last Crusade</a> whilst writing up these weeknotes.</p>

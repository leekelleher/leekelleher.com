<p>Last week I was late writing up my weeknote, same again this week! I can't blame the COVID-19 vaccine side-effects again! ðŸ˜†</p>

<p>It did take me a few days to feel fully normal again after the jab, I'm not sure whether it's a known side-effect or more disrupted sleep, I was very irritable - literally anything and everything would annoy me, quite the mardy bum! Seemed to clear up by Thursday.</p>

<p>I'd been busy again with my <a href="https://our.umbraco.com/packages/backoffice-extensions/contentment/">Contentment package</a>, did another patch release - <a href="https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment/releases/tag/1.4.2">v1.4.2</a>, few bug fixes (and hidden features). ðŸ¤«</p>

<p><a href="https://umbraco.com/blog/umbraco-9-beta-release/">Umbraco v9 (beta) was released.</a> This is the re-platforming to .NET 5 version, with initiatives to encourage established package developers to migrate their code over to the upcoming version. Historically, I have bad form in conforming to this - I've been known <em>'to let the chips fall where they may'</em> - deal with the consequences later. After all, I give my time and energy for free, there should be no expectation of me.</p>

<p><strong>But! I've had a change of heart.</strong> Maybe because Umbraco HQ are more forthcoming for this major version release, I felt more compelled. <strong>Let's do it!</strong> I've been <a href="https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment/discussions/105">keeping a log of my developer journey</a> - actually, that's where I've probably spent most of my "writing energy" these past days, no wonder I'm late on this weeknote! <a href="https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment/discussions/105">Go read it, it's a lot of words, and links, and code.</a></p>

<p>KK and I finished watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Falcon_and_the_Winter_Soldier">The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</a> - exciting finale, and a new Captain America, nice!</p>

<p>I haven't been completely sat in-front of a screen the past week. Over the bank holiday weekend, spent a lot of time outside, couple of walks, helping out my neighbours, being "Dad taxi driver" <em>(oh heck, that's a thing now isn't it?!)</em>. Had a few beers around the campfire on Saturday night, I'm not liking hangovers again, urgh.</p>

<p>We postponed our usual Saturday family movie night, as we were out in the field - camping, (well not me, I was socialising with neighbours at said campfire). So we got around to family movie night on Bank Holiday Monday evening, it was Lucy's choice - I say "choice", the kids pressurised her to pick... <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows_%E2%80%93_Part_2">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows â€“ Part 2</a>. <em>Yes!!! It is done! The Horcruxes have been destroyed, Voldemort vanquished and in future we can pick some non-franchise movies!</em></p>

<p>I did watch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stowaway_(2021_film)">Stowaway</a> on Netflix. Yet another one of these movies that popped up out of nowhere, decent trailer, solid cast, potentially predictable but good - gave it a go, it was good - but feels like another one of those fleeting Netflix titles, it'll disappear in a week or so, cast away to a distant memory.</p>

<p>Been a while since I've done a jigsaw. I now have a backlog of them. I guess doing the development work on Umbraco Contentment code has filled that void in recent weeks. I'll aim to do a jigsaw this week.</p>

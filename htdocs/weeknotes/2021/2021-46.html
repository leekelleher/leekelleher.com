<p>Another one of those weeks where it feels like no much has happened. Work is still languishing. Christmas season is looming.</p>

<p>Did a quick jigsaw. It's one that we've had for years, but I hadn't recorded it on my <a href="/jigsaws/">jigsaws page</a>, so thought I'd get it done.</p>

<p>Spending more time out in the garden, mostly pottering around, and raking up leaves - Autumn eh!</p>

<p>Alphabet Albums, we're up to "X". I really struggled to think of many bands/singers starting with X. In the end we went with: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6WK4H6AhFAt4RhuTzLFJws">XTC - Nonsuch</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7pG0kcC7rdgh4GcorfMe78">Xymox - Twist of Shadows</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3a9qH2VEsSiOZvMrjaS0Nu">Charli XCX - how i'm feeling now</a>.</p>

<p>Our regular Saturday family movie nights are still on-hold, LL is deeply into Strictly season now! But Lucy &amp; I went out to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/congresburyfolkclub">Congresbury Folk Night</a> - the band, <a href="http://www.topette.co.uk/">Topette!!</a> was very good!</p>

<p>Sunday, the weather was quite nice, so went for a long walk with LL down <a href="https://www.thestrawberryline.org.uk/">The Strawberry Line</a>.</p>

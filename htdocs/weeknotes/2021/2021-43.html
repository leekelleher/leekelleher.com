<p>It was a funny old week. The kids were on school half term holiday. I had a website launch on the Monday. Lucy was at work, so I ended up juggling kids, client and launch. A bit stressful, but all successful in the end.</p>

<p>Tuesday, Lucy and the kids went to visit a friend near London. I dropped them off at the station, and wondered why this couldn't have happened a day earlier, aw well. Just think of the things I could get done whilst they were away for a couple of days!</p>

<p>I ended up binge watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruel_Summer_(TV_series)">Cruel Summer</a> on Amazon. It was alright for a teen-drama, quite different to how the trailer suggested it would be, still I enjoyed it.</p>

<p>Thursday evening, Lucy and the girls returned. Lucy wasn't feeling to good, a bit fluey. She took a lateral flow test just to be sure it wasn't COVID... uh oh, positive result! We quickly locked her away in a bedroom! The girls did lateral flow tests straight away, both negative - thank goodness! (I hadn't left the house in a few days, so pointless testing me). Friday, Lucy went for a <abbr title="Polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. The result came back on Saturday, positive. So we all did a quick lateral flow test... LL was an immediate positive result, so straight into the locked bedroom with Lucy. KK and I were negative. We've been testing daily, negative results since. Lucy's flueyness <em>(that's not a real word!)</em> lasted 2 days, she's feeling totally fine since, same with LL. They're just bored of being locked in the bedroom... and I'm bored of being a butler.</p>

<p>In parallel to our COVID situation, Friday was the <a href="https://umbraco.com/blog/hacktoberfest-highlights-the-24-hour-umbraco-hacktoberthon/">Umbraco Hacktoberfest 24-hour Hacktoberthon</a>, <em>(I know, quite the mouthful!)</em> I attended for a few hours on the Friday, and early Saturday morning. I managed to get a few code patches in for various Umbraco projects. Nice to be involved in an Umbraco community event, as CodeGarden feels like a long time ago.</p>

<p>The weekend was mostly us trying to get to grips with the self-isolation situation. But KK did convince me to watch the rest of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things">Stranger Things</a> together, (we finished series 2).</p>

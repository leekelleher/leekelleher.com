<p>The Omicron COVID-19 variant was on the increase in the UK. Oddly, with the 10-day self-isolation rule in place, Tuesday was the last day you could test positive for COVID-19 if you didn't want to be isolating on Christmas day. This meant that I ended up cancelling on a bunch of planned social events this week.</p>

<p>Wednesday, the latest <abbr title="Marvel Cinematic Universe">MCU</abbr> movie was out, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_No_Way_Home">Spider-Man: No Way Home</a>. KK and I went on the opening night. No spoilers. The were a lot of MCU fans in the audience, much applauding throughout the movie.</p>

<p>Thursday, Lucy and I got our 3<sup>rd</sup> COVID jab - the booster. I'd anticipated that it'd wipe me out later in the day, so chilled out watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombieland:_Double_Tap">Zombieland: Double Tap</a> in the afternoon. <em>(I'm not sure why I hadn't seen this before, as I very much enjoyed the first Zombieland movie.)</em> Turns out that I felt fine for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>Friday, spoke too soon, this was the day of the post-booster wipe out. Both Lucy and I felt exhausted. So back on the sofa, I watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shazam!_(film)">Shazam!</a> - <em>which was alright</em>. Slept for most of the day.</p>

<p><strong>Alphabet Albums</strong>, we reached the final letter, "Z", what a year it was been... <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7l2wh3iJzOz8dIm0NQ3Puw">Sophie Zelmani - Sophie Zelmani</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4Bzf9YmnONarbJWRp258DW">Zuzu's Petals - When No One's Looking</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0EAvEtr7fMd70XgVnKYW0j">The Zutons - Who Killed The Zutons?</a></p>

<p>Saturday, we got our Christmas tree, <em>(yup, a real one, pines everywhere!)</em> LL's school choir did some carols in the precinct. The Christmas Open Mic night got cancelled, due to low numbers <em>(which I'd already decided not to attend, still feel bad that it got cancelled).</em> Although this did mean that we could all watch the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strictly_Come_Dancing_(series_19)">Strictly Come Dancing final</a> together. <em>(I'd predicted the winner from around week 2 or 3.)</em></p>

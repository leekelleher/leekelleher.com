<p>I'm a week late writing up my notes for week 28. We had a bit of a heatwave in the UK, it was one of those where I tried to spend more time outside instead of being stuck in-front of a screen. So now I'm trying to recall what I did the previous week.</p>

<p>I finished the doughnuts jigsaw...</p>

<p>KK and I watched the end of the first season of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki_(TV_series)">Loki</a>. It was a weird one, we were expecting an action packed finale, but turned out to be a more dialogue driven character piece, setting up for future <abbr title="Marvel Cinematic Universe">MCU</abbr> plots.</p>

<p>All of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_(TV_series)">The Walking Dead</a> seasons got added to Disney+. I used to watch it regularly, (I've read all the comic books too), but once the main characters (Rick and Carl) got killed off, I lost interest and stopped watching after season 9. So since it's been a year or so, I thought I'd give season 10 a go. I enjoyed it. I still like many of the original/early characters. Always interesting to see how closely it follows the comic book storyline and where it veers off from it.</p>

<p><b>Alphabet Albums</b>, we're up to "O"... <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2k5TrAeodafPre7e6ZN7RE">William Onyeabor - Atomic Bomb</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4l8JV50ME3r5Zvm9NOSuA8">Octopus - From A To B</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2pQR3eAJ3ufT2q1PEF1VaW">Orange Juice - You Can't Hide Your Love Forever </a>.</p>

<p>Friday, we got a call from KK's school... yup, a positive COVID-19 case on her bus, so 10-days self-isolation again! Worse part is that there was only 3 days of school left before the summer break.</p>

<p>Saturday family movie night was Lucy's choice... and because of the heatwave, she chose for us to have a BBQ in the field and watch the sunset.</p>

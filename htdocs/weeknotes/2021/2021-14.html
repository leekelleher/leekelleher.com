<p>Double Bank Holidays, great for long weekends, confusing for the following work week - especially during the current lockdown mindset. "<em>No, I did that yesterday, on Monday</em>", "<em>but today is Wednesday</em>", "<em>No, today is Tuesday!</em>", oops! <em>I lost track of days (again)!</em></p>

<p>I can't wait for that bloomin' haircut!</p>

<p>My knee has been recovering this past week, still taking it easy, doesn't ache when I bend it now.</p>

<p>We had really odd weather last week, given it was so sunny over the Easter weekend, by Tuesday there were hailstorms - thought it was going to snow at one point.</p>

<p>Finally released an update for my Umbraco plugin, <a href="https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment/releases/tag/1.3.0">Contentment v1.3.0</a>! Some new features and bug fixes. Since enabling the <a href="https://leekelleher.com/umbraco/contentment/telemetry/">telemetry statistics</a>, I've been enjoying seeing which features are being used, (and maybe more interestingly, which are not).</p>

<p>Thursday was back to the dentist for impressions... "<em>uh huh, hulo, my name is Lee.</em>" ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è My dentist tells me that the impressions will be sent off to Sweden for the crown modelling, that'll take between 3 to 6 weeks. Couldn't help but wonder if Brexit had any impact on those timescales. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

<p>Ah, Friday, the next letter day in <b>Alphabet Albums</b>. We're up to "H" now... <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5z090LQztiqh13wYspQvKQ">Jimi Hendrix Experience - Electric Ladyland</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0Z87Gj37OpbEjQ6qwv3TPD">Nick Heyward - The Apple Bed</a>, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2yMg8ronKfVDHngnlLNnl8">PJ Harvey - To Bring You My Love</a>.</a></p>

<p>KK has now finished watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WandaVision">WandaVision</a>. There are couple of things that I had to subtly prepare her for, e.g. she hadn't seen any of the X-Men movies, and I didn't want the Pietro re-cast to go over her head, so I put a few YouTube clips of cool scenes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men:_Days_of_Future_Past">X-Men: Days of Future Past</a>, (with no real explanation), then when the reveal happened in the WandaVision episode she was like "wait a minute!" üòÜ ...and <strong>Agatha All Along</strong> has been stuck in our heads for days!</p>

<p>She's now pushing to watch Falcon and Winter Soldier, but I'm pushing back for a couple of weeks, too much MCU!</p>

<p>Saturday family movie night was LL's choice... <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince_(film)">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a>. More of the movie franchises, we're enjoying them, but they're all blurring into one for me now! <em>(For any regular readers may have spotted that it shouldn't have been LL's turn to pick, we goofed up, it should have been KK's turn, eek, doh!)</em></p>

<p>Rest of the weekend, we've been out in the garden again. Time to <strong>get my hedge cut!</strong> <em>(cue <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1Ztx8USNZNhuU8iWwuFmw9?si=fb1d0eadb8df41ec">"Every Time A Bell Rings"</a>)</em>.</p>

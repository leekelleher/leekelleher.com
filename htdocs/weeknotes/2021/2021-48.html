<p>December has arrived. Where has the year gone?</p>

<p>With advent calendars, Lucy likes to do more activity based ones for the kids, less chocolate, more craft based stuff. Much to their surprise, I got them Lindt chocolate advent calendars - so now each morning is a mix of chocolate and crafts.</p>

<p>I started watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles:_Get_Back">The Beatles: Get Back</a> documentary series on Disney+, I'm quite a fan of The Beatles, and this is an epic watch. I'm halfway through so far. Love watching their song writing process.</p>

<p>Thursday was Lucy's birthday. We out for a walk and lunch around <a href="https://www.n-somerset.gov.uk/sites/default/files/2020-03/Wander%20through%20tranquil%20woodland%20-%20Leigh%20Woods%20%28winter%20special%202017%29.pdf">Leigh Woods</a>. In the evening, went for a curry at Yatton Tandoori.</p>

<p>It's been a while since mentioning the <abbr title="Marvel Cinematic Universe">MCU</abbr>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawkeye_(2021_TV_series)">Hawkeye</a> TV show has started on Disney+. KK and I have watched the first 3 episodes.</p>

<p>Friday meant Alphabet Albums time again, we're up to "Y"... <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0ImT9xKissO4j4oU4zUAIG">Yello - Flag</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrmMAvtYIQg&list=PLFtXhl189dSZRYkQ9GVdJJL8-fi7RX6Je">Yeah Yeah Noh - Cutting The Heavenly Lawn Of Greatness... Last Rites For The God Of Love</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0uoqdDFfwAteblEbZt7PO2">Paul Young - No Parlez</a>.</p>

<p>Saturday morning was busy in little old Yatton. The Bowling Club had a coffee &amp; cake morning, with a jigsaw puzzle sale - we bought 4 jigsaws; and a new music school/cafe/venue called <a href="http://www.thenotewarehouse.co.uk/">The Note Warehouse</a> had a welcome open day. In the afternoon, I did one of the jigsaws we got, a 300 piece world map, but from 1984, interesting to see how the world has changed since then.</p>

<p>Sunday, did bits of Christmas shopping. Also went to Halfords to get the car headline bulb replaced. I'd had a look (and YouTube search) to see if I could do it, honestly, for what you'd think was a simple task turned out to be quite complex. Glad I went to Halfords, as it took 2 guys about half an hour to replace the bulb - I'd have probably given up and bought a new car instead.</p>

<p>Sunday family movie night, LL wanted to watch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(film)">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>. Cramming it in before the Strictly Come Dancing quarter-final results. <em>(Only a few weeks left before it's over!)</em> ðŸ˜†</p>

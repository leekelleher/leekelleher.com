<p>Ah, the run up to Christmas. It was a strange week. Work had already been slowing down, but I'm not sure where the days went. The kids had already broken up for the school holiday, I guess I'd been playing more video games with them than I realised.</p>

<p>Wednesday, we had <a href="https://www.gigaclear.com/">Gigaclear</a> installed. Some digging up the front garden to get the cables all wired up, but was quickly done. Ultrafast internet here we come!</p>

<p>In the evening we went along to <a href="https://www.lightupbristol.com/">Light Up Bristol</a> at Ashton Court.</p>

<p>Our annual umBristol Xmas Shindig was cancelled, the rise of the COVID/Omicron variant felt too risky for a social/pub visit, especially this close to Christmas day.</p>

<p>Christmas Eve, whilst Lucy and the kids went shopping, I had a sneaky trip to the cinema to watch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_Resurrections">The Matrix Resurrections</a>. <em>(I'm a huge fan of the original movie, but I have very mixed feelings about this one, I enjoyed it, but overall undecided, I'll need to watch it again.)</em> The cinema was completely empty, weird being the only one in there!</p>

<p>Christmas day, we went to Lucy's folks. All round, a pleasant, stress free day. Kids enjoyed their presents, although being at their grandparents, they didn't get full chance to enjoy them until Boxing day.</p>

<p>Ah, Boxing day. I came down with flu. Hit me out of the blue, <em>(strange that I felt fine on Christmas day)</em>, totally wiped me out. Aching and sore throat. I was worried that it was COVID, but had a negative lateral flow test result. I was hoping it'd be a 24-hour virus thing, as I typically get the annual seasonal flu - but usually around September time, which passes in a couple of days. Fingers crossed. ðŸ¤ž</p>

<p>Since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shang-Chi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings">Shang-Chi</a> got released on Disney+ a couple of weeks back, I'd been asking KK if/when she wanted to watch it, but she kept putting me off, so I watched it without her! üòù <em>(Much to her disgust when she later found out!)</em></p>

<p>I'm trying to go out for more walks during the week (and in daylight hours). I think being stuck at my desk for long periods of time has taken its toll on me.</p>

<p>Friday, I ventured into Bristol to attend the <a href="https://umbraco.community/together">Umbraco Together</a> event. I wasn't sure how the day would pan out, given it was a set of 3 simultaneous mini-festivals (the others in Glasgow and London), many of the sessions were live-streamed from London. At times it felt that Bristol &amp; Glasgow were second-class citizens to London, but then I'm unsure how else it could have been done, difficult times, but overall a well orchestrated event.</p>

<p>Saturday night, (after Strictly), KK asked if we could watch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shang-Chi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings">Shang-Chi</a>, so we did. I enjoyed it a second time!</p>

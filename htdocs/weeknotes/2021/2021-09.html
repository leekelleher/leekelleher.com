<p>That was it, the last week of remote learning ðŸŽ‰ - except not quite. LL goes back from Monday, <em>(today, I'm late writing this note up)</em>, but KK's school is doing a staggered start, so she's back next Monday. Still, it's going to be quiter during the day in our house.</p>

<p>KK ramped up on watching <abbr title="Marvel Cinematic Universe">MCU</abbr> movies. We watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_America:_The_Winter_Soldier">Captain America 2</a> on Monday night, I'd been trying to keep any spoilers from KK, her face was priceless when she found out who <strong>The Winter Solider</strong> was, classic! Wednesday night, we watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers:_Age_of_Ultron">Avengers 2</a>, which was good timing for me, to revisit the backstory in preparation for WandaVision.</p>

<p>re: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WandaVision">WandaVision</a>, <em>(the finale, it was very good!)</em>, without much of a spoiler, there's a scene where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus">Ship of Theseus</a> dilemma is discussed - I couldn't help but think of that Only Fools and Horses sketch, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56yN2zHtofM&amp;t=90s">Trigger's Broom</a>.</p>

<p>Watched the concluding episodes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Serpent_(TV_series)">The Serpent</a>, really good, enjoyed this show.</p>

<p>Started another jigsaw, a 1000 piece one, this time with a view to take it at a slower pace. Not several hours in a single sitting, but over the course of several days. By the end of Tuesday I had edging done. Came back to it on Wednesday for an hour or so, struggled to make any progress. By Thursday, Lucy had took over, she's been enjoying it, so I left her to it.<br>I'm probably having that typical programmer syndrome of "flow", in a single sitting I could keep a mental model of the problem, whereas doing it in piecemeal it takes time for me to get back up to speed.</p>

<p>Thursday, I <a href="https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment/releases/tag/1.2.0">released v1.2.0 of my Contentment plugin</a> for Umbraco. One of the new features is <a href="https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment/blob/develop/docs/telemetry.md">Telemetry data</a> - my aim is to use this so that I can understand how plugin's components are being used. I put together a <a href="https://leekelleher.com/umbraco/contentment/telemetry/">report page that analyses the telemetry data</a>, this will be useful to see where to best focus my efforts for future developments.</p>

<p>Saturday family movie night was Lucy's choice... <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_(2015_film)">Pan</a>. It was alright, kids seemed to enjoy it, but I couldn't escape the question of <strong><em>why?!</em></strong> Did anyone actually want a prequel for Peter Pan? Maybe the film-makers were hoping for a big series of follow up movies? I don't know, just felt odd.</p>

	<summary>Sunday. I did another collage!</summary>
	<p>As I was about to throw out the OK! and Vogue magazines, I thought I'd take one last flick through them. Noticed a few nice black &amp; white shots, so I got the scissors and glue out again. Bit of a simplier one this time around, tried to keep it classy.</p>
	<p>I named this one <strong>Director's C<ins>a</ins><del>u</del>t</strong>.</p>

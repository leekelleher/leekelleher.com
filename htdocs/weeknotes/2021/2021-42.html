<p>Concerning start to the week, some of LL's friends tested positive for COVID-19, a few of them she'd been in close contact with at the previous weekend's Brownies camp, and Lucy had driven the girls to the camp. So it was off for a <abbr title="Polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test for Lucy and LL, and self-isolation while they waited for the results. Next day the results came back as negative. <em>Funny how it goes.</em></p>

<p>Past several days I had a dull nagging toothache, one of my older crowns. I got an appointment with the dentist on Wednesday, took an x-ray, I had an infection under the crown. On a course of antibiotics for the next week. <em>(Which pretty much cleared the toothache after a day.)</em></p>

<p>Wednesday, I finally released the latest version of my Umbraco package, <a href="https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment/releases/tag/3.0.0">Contentment v3.0.0</a>. Good to get it out of beta and stable.</p>

<p>Saturday was my Mum's birthday. I took the kids up to Liverpool for a surprise visit. Left early Saturday morning, stayed overnight, headed back early Sunday. Short and sweet, a flying visit.</p>

<p>A friend suggested that we watch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Osman%27s_House_of_Games">Richard Osman's House of Games</a> on BBC2. I love quiz shows, but generally stay away from the celebrity quiz shows - as they tend to be quite shallow. Watched it throughout the week, it was alright but probably more of an occasional watch than every day.</p>

<p>Tuesday was LL's "freedom" day. Straight back to school. She was excited about it, couldn't wait to see her friends.</p>

<p>I got around to doing another jigsaw puzzle. It'd been a month since I last did one. We have a backlog of jigsaws that we've either borrowed from friends or acquired from charity shops, so this was more of a case of pick one, do it, and move it on.</p>

<p>Work has been languishing for a while now, it's been an odd mix of feeling extremely busy, at the same time, there's not much to do. Between work tasks, I may have secretly become a bit obsessed with <a href="http://slither.io/">slither.io</a>. <em>Gah, it's only when you admit it, that you realise you really have become a boring middle aged man. Maybe I need a holiday?</em></p>

<p>TV wise, KK and I have been continuing with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things">Stranger Things</a> season 3.</p>

<p>A friend is building a summer house, on Saturday he was having ready mixed concrete delivered - I offered to help shift it to the garden - 4 of us had 30 minutes to shift 98 barrels! Let's just say that I'm woefully aware how unfit I am, and my shoulders ached the next day!</p>

<p>Remembrance Sunday, we went to <a href="https://www.warmemorialsonline.org.uk/memorial/94938">Yatton's war memorial garden</a> for the service.</p>

<p>Shocked to hear about the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-59291095">terror incident at Liverpool Women's Hospital</a>. The surrounding news coverage was all felt quite close to home (despite being two hundred miles away).</p>

<p><em>Oops, I did it again. I'm a week late writing up my notes. I'm managing to keep rough notes during the week, but procrastinating on the write-up. I'm not sure why. Maybe it's the time of the year, less daylight, bit burned out from recent work, not sure. I'll persevere.</em></p>

<p>Tuesday was the big release for <a href="https://umbraco.com/blog/umbraco-9-release/">Umbraco v9!</a> HQ put on an excellent webinar for the launch. All very well received by the community, with a fair amount of excitement surrounding it. In the evening we had an <a href="https://www.meetup.com/umBristol/events/280238521/">umBristol in-person meet-up</a>, our first in 18 months. We'd previously dabbled with virtual meet-ups, but found they didn't have the same experience for our meet-up group. It was great to catch up with everyone. At the end of the night, <a href="https://twitter.com/Steve_Gibe">Steve</a> gave us a lift home in his Tesla, first time I'd been in one, very impressive!</p>

<p>It's been a while since mentioning <abbr title="Marvel Cinematic Universe">MCU</abbr>. I've been watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_If...%3F_(TV_series)">What If...</a> with the kids. Good fun.</p>

<p>Friday night we had another band practice, this time we booked out a rehearsal studio - we recently got a new member (on lead guitar) and been struggling to find a good practice space. We tried out <a href="http://whitenoiseonline.uk/">White Noise Studio</a> down in Weston-super-Mare. At first it felt an unusual set-up, a warehouse unit in the middle of nowhere, turned out quite good. Most likely go back there soon.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, it was raining - so no gardening - decided to hacking around on <a href="https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment">Contentment</a> - preparing for next release. I always forget how much work goes into making an release - even more now I'm developing/testing against Umbraco v8 and v9!</p>

<p>Whilst coding, I had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game">Squid Game</a> (Netflix) on in the background. About halfway through episode one, I think the coding became the background task. Oh my days, the tug of war scene was nerve wracking! Watched most of it over the weekend - it's a familiar plot, (I'm a big fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Royale_(film)">Battle Royale</a> anyway), but the writing and characters are great. Definitely worth a watch.</p>

<p>Sunday, one of our friends was doing the <a href="https://www.tcslondonmarathon.com/the-event/virtual-marathon">Virtual London Marathon</a> around the local towns/villages. We went to various milestones to cheer him on, and back to his house for a big finish line. Later on we went to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thepearorchardltd/">The Pear Orchard</a> (again) for a late-lunch/early-dinner.</p>

<p>Sunday evening was spent packing LL's bags, for her week long school trip to <a href="http://www.morfabay.com/">Morfa Bay Adventure</a>.</p>

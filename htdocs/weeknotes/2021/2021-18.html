<p>The past week, I spent a significant amount of time on the migrating of my <a href="https://our.umbraco.com/packages/backoffice-extensions/contentment/">Contentment package</a> over to Umbraco v9 (e.g. .NET Core version). Hit various snags, found workarounds, I'm still <a href="https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment/discussions/105">journaling my progress</a>, if you wanted to follow along at home.</p>

<p>It'd been several weeks since I'd last done a larger jigsaw, so decided to tackle this one that my Dad recently gave us.</p>

<p>I'd started it Tuesday evening for a couple of hours, sorted the edges. The rest was done during Wednesday, an hour or so in the morning, again at lunch, then a few hours in the evening. That's the trouble with these jigsaws, once we've got going on them, can't seem to stop until it's done.</p>

<p>A couple of my good Umbraco friends, <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbrailsford">Matt</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/KevinJump">Kevin</a>, have started a podcast! <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7BQFm8NKL0RboHGLDx2OmX">Package Manifest</a> - which is all about Umbraco package development and the people that create them. Matt did ask me to be one of the co-hosts, but I politely declined - I'm making an effort not to over-commit myself these days. I'm sure I'll be on as a guest at some point.</p>

<p>Mentioning commitments, prior to the first UK COVID-19 lockdown, <a href="http://thedysfunctions.uk/">my band</a> had started recording our first album - we actually recorded the drums on the weekend before the lockdown happened. I was due to record the bass shortly after. We did try to do it all remotely, but it got a bit stressful - mostly due to technical frustrations, unfamiliar with the software, juggling work + kids + general lockdown woes. I mean, we did manage to get a couple of songs together - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN0YcNHVdjvU0gfxKMq6d9Q">they're up on YouTube</a> - but for the whole album we wanted to aim for higher quality, so the album got put on-hold.</p>

<p>That is, until after the 17<sup>th</sup> May - when the next lockdown easing happens and we can meet up indoors! So I've been frantically practising (and re-learning) all the songs. Feels a bit like a fitness regime, <em>maybe I need a montage?!</em></p>

<p><b>Alphabet Albums</b> came round fast (again), we're up to "J"... <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3Us57CjssWnHjTUIXBuIeH">Michael Jackson - Bad</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7kHvpj74cgrJuJ2K6E0mUm">Jethro Tull - Stand Up</a>, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2B9q4KPjOEYu885Keo9dfX">Jack Johnson - In Between Dreams</a>.</a></p>

<p>Saturday family movie night was KK's choice... <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratatouille_(film)">Ratatouille</a>. KK claims to have never had seen it - I'm sure we had. It's a great movie, kids loved it, but I fell asleep halfway through.</p>

<p>Sunday, at a bit of a loose end, thought I'd start off another jigsaw - do the edges and leave it for a bit. That didn't go to plan - 5 hours later...</p>

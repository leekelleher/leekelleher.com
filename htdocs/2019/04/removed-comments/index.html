			<p>I've decided to remove the comments from my blog. There were a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>First, they aren't being used. It's been 3 years since the last comment. Not that my posts are opinionated and require debate, most of them are informational, so this doesn't surprise me. My assumption is that Twitter has made blog comments less relevant over the past 10 years.</p>
<p>Second, I was using the Disqus commenting system. Overall Disqus offers a great service. However in my efforts to 'go <a href="https://leekelleher.com/2016/03/back-to-basics/">back to basics</a>', I'd noticed that Disqus pumps in a huge amount of JavaScript. Taking into account that no one is commenting, it's an overhead that I didn't need.</p>
<p>I've exported all the existing comments from Disqus. I'm not sure what I'll do with them yet. Time will tell.</p>
<p>If there is anything you'd like to comment on - whether it be a specific post or anything in general - you can reach me either via my <a href="https://leekelleher.com/contact/">contact form</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/leekelleher">tweet me</a>.</p>
